Climate models from CMIP5 and CMIP6 translate this regional temperature change to a global warming threshold of 2.7 ± 0.2°C. Under a high-end warming scenario, this threshold may be reached around 2055, while for a strong mitigation scenario it will likely not be passed.

Land models translate climate projections into surface impacts, but these will be inaccurate if ESMs have substantial errors. Bias concerns are relevant for terrestrial physiological processes which often respond non-linearly (i.e. contain threshold responses) and are therefore sensitive to absolute environmental conditions as well as changes. We bias-correct the UK Met Office ESM, HadGEM2-ES, against the CRU–JRA observation-based gridded estimates of recent climate. We apply the derived bias corrections to future projections by HadGEM2-ES for the RCP8.5 scenario of future greenhouse gas concentrations. Focusing on South America, the bias correction includes adjusting for ESM estimates that, annually, are approximately 1 degree too cold, for comparison against 21st Century warming of around 4 degrees. Locally, these values can be much higher. The ESM is also too wet on average, by approximately 1 mm·day−1, which is substantially larger than the mean predicted change. The corrected climate fields force the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) dynamic global vegetation model to estimate land surface changes, with an emphasis on the carbon cycle. Results show land carbon sink reductions across South America, and in some locations, the net land–atmosphere CO2 flux becomes a source to the atmosphere by the end of this century. Transitions to a CO2 source is where increases in plant net primary productivity are offset by larger enhancements in soil respiration. Bias-corrected simulations estimate the rise in South American land carbon stocks between pre-industrial times and the end of the 2080s is ∼12 GtC lower than that without climate bias removal, demonstrating the importance of merging historical observational meteorological forcing with ESM diagnostics. We present evidence for a substantial climate-induced role of greater soil decomposition in the fate of the Amazon carbon sink. © 2021 The Authors.

Climate change leads to changes in precipitation patterns and thereby changes in patterns of discharge and flood inundation. Consequently, estimating these changes using any numerical models is deemed essential to develop countermeasures. There is growing anticipation of climate change over Cambodia and the lower Prek Thnot River Basin, yet it is unknown how serious climate change is on the basin's hydrological and especially flood characteristics. Thus, this study aims to assess the change impacts by integrating the Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to apply in the lower Prek Thnot River Basin, Cambodia, whose susceptibility to climate change is relatively high. The RRI model was integrated with the discharge outputs from the SWAT model to simulate four flood events: 2000, the biggest flood event, 2001, 2010, and 2020 flood events. Hydrographs, water levels, and flood extent maps for these events were generated. The biggest flood event of 2000 was set as the baseline period for a possible flood event in the future projected climate in the 2030s and 2060s using three general circulation models (GCMs) [Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model, version 3 (GFDL-CM3), Goddard Institute for Space Studies Model E2, coupled with Russell and interactive terrestrial Carbon Cycle (GISS-E2-R-CC), and Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model, version 5A, Medium Resolution (IPSL-CM5A-MR)] under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) including RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. The results of climate change suggested that flood magnitude in the lower Prek Thnot River Basin will vary slightly in the 2030s and greatly in the 2060s. In the 2030s, relative changes in precipitation between -8.2% and 21.6% could lead to relative changes in extreme flow (Q5, flow exceeding 5% of the time) of -21.4%-8.4%, changes in peak water level of -6.3%-1.3%, and changes in inundated area of -12%-7.4%. In the 2060s, relative changes in precipitation between -17.7% and 46.4% could lead to relative changes in Q5 of -39.3%-13.5%, in peak water level of -19.6%-5.2%, and in inundated area from -31.4% to 20.7%. These relative changes imply the increases and decreases due to climate change compared with the present climate. Overall, the resultant outputs of this study revealed how impactful climate change is on the basin's hydrological and flood characteristics, which have long been in question. The results can thus be deployed to underpin decision making and offset the impending negative impacts of climate change on flood inundation within the lower Prek Thnot River Basin.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Climate change; Flood inundation; Lower Prek Thnot River Basin; Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model","Cambodia; Prek Thnot Basin; Climate change; Climate models; Flood control; Floods; Rain; Rivers; Runoff; Water levels; Watersheds; Flood event; Flood inundation; Inundation modelling; Low prek thnot river basin; Rainfall runoff; Rainfall-runoff-inundation  model; River basins; Soil and water assessment tool  model; Soil and Water assessment tools; Tool models; climate change; climate effect; extreme event; flood; flood damage; flooding; rainfall-runoff modeling; soil and water assessment tool; SWAT","T.

Several state-of-the-art ice flow models are currently being employed on various grid resolutions to estimate future mass changes in the framework of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). Here we investigate the sensitivity to grid resolution of centennial sea-level contributions from the Greenland ice sheet and study the mechanism at play.We employ the finiteelement higher-order Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) and conduct experiments with four different horizontal resolutions, namely 4, 2, 1 and 0.75 km. We run the simulation based on the ISMIP6 core climate forcing from the MIROC5 global circulation model (GCM) under the highemission Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario and consider both atmospheric and oceanic forcing in full and separate scenarios. Under the full scenarios, finer simulations unveil up to approximately 5% more sea-level rise compared to the coarser resolution. The sensitivity depends on the magnitude of outlet glacier retreat, which is implemented as a series of retreat masks following the ISMIP6 protocol. Without imposed retreat under atmosphereonly forcing, the resolution dependency exhibits an opposite behaviour with approximately 5% more sea-level contribution in the coarser resolution. The sea-level contribution indicates a converging behaviour below a 1 km horizontal resolution. A driving mechanism for differences is the ability to resolve the bedrock topography, which highly controls ice discharge to the ocean. Additionally, thinning and acceleration emerge to propagate further inland in high resolution for many glaciers. A major response mechanism is sliding, with an enhanced feedback on the effective normal pressure at higher resolution leading to a larger increase in sliding speeds under scenarios with outlet glacier retreat. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

However, estimating carbon-climate feedback for these gases remains fraught with uncertainties, especially under overshoot scenarios. This study investigates the impact of CO2 and non-CO2 gases with nearly equal levels of effective radiative forcing on the climate and carbon cycle, using the Earth system model (ESM) IPSL-CM6A-LR. We first present a method to recalibrate methane and nitrous oxide concentrations to align with published radiative forcings, ensuring accurate model performance. Next, we carry out a series of idealised ramp-up and ramp-down concentration-driven experiments and show that, while the impacts of increasing and decreasing CO2 and non-CO2 gases on the surface climate are nearly equivalent (when their radiative forcing magnitudes are set to be the same), regional differences emerge. We further explore the carbon cycle feedbacks and demonstrate that they differ under CO2 and non-CO2 forcing. CO2 forcing leads to both carbon-climate and carbon-concentration feedbacks, whereas non-CO2 gases give rise to the carbon-climate feedback only. We introduce a framework, building on previous studies that addressed CO2 forcing, to separate the carbon-climate feedback into a temperature term and a temperature-CO2 cross-term. Our findings reveal that these feedback terms are comparable in magnitude for the global ocean. This underscores the importance of considering both terms in carbon cycle feedback framework and climate change mitigation strategies. © 2025 Irina Melnikova et al.","","Kyoto Protocol; Carbon cycles; Climate feedbacks; CO2 gas; CO2 mitigation; Forcings; Greenhouses gas; Nitrous oxide; Radiative forcings; Reducing emissions; Uncertainty; carbon cycle; climate change; climate modeling; concentration (composition); estimation method; radiative forcing; Greenhouse gas emissions","I.

Solar radiation modification (SRM) has the potential to slow SLR by temporarily reducing anthropogenic warming. This study compares observed sea level data along Thailand’s coasts with outputs from 3 global climate models (GCMs) in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6: CNRM-ESM2-1, IPSL-CM6A-LR, and UKESM1-0-LL. Observations include tide gauge data from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level, vertical land motion from the Global Navigation Satellite Systems, and coastal altimetry from the X-TRACK dataset. SLR trends from observations and models generally agree, including near Bangkok, but uncertainties arise in some areas due to challenges in land motion measurements. GCM outputs for 2 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) and 2 SRM simulations (G6Solar, G6Sulfur) project end-of-century SLR rates ranging from 2 mm/yr (SSP2-4.5) to over 5 mm/yr (SSP5-8.5). SRM reduces SLR, with G6Sulfur showing slightly greater suppression than G6Solar because of stronger tropical ocean cooling and less ice sheet melting. Seasonal sea-level variabilities are well represented in GCMs and projected to remain unchanged in the future, but will amplify coastal impacts during seasonal highs. The Upper Gulf of Thailand experiences an additional 0.2 m seasonal SLR in December-February because of stronger northeast monsoon, while stronger southwest monsoon causes an additional 0.1 m seasonal SLR along the Andaman coast in June-August. Uncertainties in this study arise from nonlinear land subsidence due to recent groundwater extraction controls, limited observational data coverage, and internal model variability. © 2025 The Author(s).","Climate change; Dynamic sea level; Oceanic thermal expansion; Sea level rise; Solar radiation modification; Vertical land motion","Gulf of Thailand; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; climate change; global climate; ice sheet; sea level; solar radiation; thermal expansion; tide gauge","P.

However, intermodel differences in the magnitude and spatial patterns of steric sea level rise exist at regional scales and often emerge during the spinup and preindustrial control integrations of climate models. Steric sea level results from an eddy-permitting climate model, GFDL CM4, are compared with a lower-resolution counterpart, GFDL-ESM4. The results from both models are examined through basin-scale heat budgets and watermass analysis, and we compare the patterns of ocean heat uptake, redistribution, and sea level differ in ocean-only [i.e., Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (OMIP)] and coupled climate configurations. After correcting for model drift, both GFDL CM4 and GFDL-ESM4 simulate nearly equivalent ocean heat content change and global sea level rise during the historical period. However, the GFDL CM4 model exhibits as much as a 40% increase in surface ocean heat uptake in the Southern Ocean and subsequent increases in horizontal export to other ocean basins after bias correction. The results suggest regional differences in the processes governing Southern Ocean heat export, such as the formation of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), Subpolar Mode Water (SPMW), and gyre transport between the two models, and that sea level changes in these models cannot be fully bias-corrected. Since the process-level differences between the two models are evident in the preindustrial control simulations of both models, these results suggest that the control simulations are important for identifying and correcting sea level–related model biases. © 2024 American Meteorological Society.","Ocean; Ocean circulation; Ocean dynamics; Ocean models; Sea level","Southern Ocean; Hydrogeology; Miocene; Sea level; Seawater; Tropics; Watersheds; Model drift; Ocean; Ocean circulation; Ocean dynamics; Ocean heat uptake; Ocean model; Pre-industrial; Sea level rise; Steric sea level; Water mass; Antarctic Intermediate Water; climate modeling; computer simulation; error correction; gyre; historical perspective; mode water; numerical model; oceanic circulation; sea level change; water mass; Budget control","J.P.

Since these trends are expected to continue, it is essential to explore the GrIS SMB response to projected climate warming. We compare projections from three polar regional climate models, RACMO, MAR, and HIRHAM, forced by the Community Earth System Model CESM2 under a high-end warming scenario (SSP5-8.5, 1970–2099). We reveal different modeled SMB by 2100, including a twofold larger annual surface mass loss in MAR (−1735 Gt/yr) and HIRHAM (−1698 Gt/yr) relative to RACMO (−964 Gt/yr). Discrepancies primarily stem from differences in projected runoff, triggering melt-albedo positive feedback and subsequent modeled ablation zone expansion. In addition, we find different responses of modeled meltwater production to similar atmospheric warming.

Here, we apply the Adaptive Emissions Reduction Approach to the Earth System Model GFDL-ESM2M to conduct novel overshoot scenarios that reach 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0°C of global warming before returning to 1.5°C over the time period of 1861–2500. We also perform a complementary scenario that stabilizes global temperature at 1.5°C, allowing to isolate impacts caused by the temperature overshoots alone, both during their peaks and after their reversals. The simulations indicate that substantial residual ocean surface warming persists in the high latitudes after the overshoots, with most notable regional anomalies occurring in the North Atlantic (up to +3.1°C in the 3°C overshoot scenario compared to the 1.5°C stabilization scenario) and the Southern Ocean (+1.2°C). The residual warming is primarily driven by the recoveries of the Atlantic and Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation and associated increases in ocean heat transport. Excess subsurface heat storage in low and mid-latitudes prevents steric sea level rise (SLR) from reverting to 1.5°C stabilization levels in any overshoot scenario, with steric sea level remaining up to 32% higher in the 3°C overshoot scenario on centennial time scales. Both peak impacts and persistent changes after overshoot reversal bear significant implications for future assessments of coastlines, regional climates, marine ecosystems, and ice sheets. © 2024.

At regional scale, the evolution of sea level probability distributions is often assumed to be dominated by changes in the mean. However, a quantification of changes in distributional shapes in a changing climate is currently missing. To this end, we propose a novel framework quantifying significant changes in probability distributions from time series data. The framework first quantifies linear trends in quantiles through quantile regression. Quantile slopes are then projected onto a set of four orthogonal polynomials quantifying how such changes can be explained by independent shifts in the first four statistical moments. The framework proposed is theoretically founded, general, and can be applied to any climate observable with close-To-linear changes in distributions. We focus on observations and a coupled climate model (GFDL-CM4). In the historical period, trends in coastal daily sea level have been driven mainly by changes in the mean and can therefore be explained by a shift of the distribution with no change in shape. In the modeled world, robust changes in higher order moments emerge with increasing concentration. Such changes are driven in part by ocean circulation alone and get amplified by sea level pressure fluctuations, with possible consequences for sea level extremes attribution studies.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Climate models; non-Gaussian statistics; nonstationary processes; probability distributions; sea level","","F.

In this study, regional temperature changes in an atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (HadCM3) are partitioned between excess (due to perturbed surface heat fluxes) and redistributed (arising from changing circulation and perturbations to mixing) components. In simulations with historical forcing, we first compare this excess–redistribution partitioning with the spice and heave decomposition, in which temperature anomalies enter the ocean interior either along isopycnals (spice) or across isopycnals (heave, without affecting the temperature–salinity curve). Second, heat and salinity budgets projected into thermohaline space naturally reveal the mechanisms behind temperature change by spice and heave linked with water mass generation or destruction. Excess warming enters the ocean as warming by heave in subtropical gyres whereas it mainly projects onto warming by spice in the Southern Ocean and the tropical Atlantic. In subtropical gyres, Ekman pumping generates excess warming as confirmed by Eulerian heat budgets. In contrast, isopycnal mixing partly drives warming and salinification by spice, as confirmed by budgets in thermohaline space, underlying the key role of salinity changes for the ocean warming signature. Our study suggests a method to detect excess warming using spice and heave calculated from observed repeat profiles of temperature and salinity. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Climate variability; Heat budgets/fluxes; Ocean circulation; Ocean dynamics; Ocean models; Water masses/storage","Atmospheric temperature; Budget control; Circuit simulation; Climate models; Heat flux; Mixing; Sea level; Tropics; 'spice'; Climate variability; Heat budgets/fluxes; Mass storage; Ocean circulation; Ocean dynamics; Ocean model; Temperature changes; Water mass; Water mass/storage; Climate change","L.

Global climate models that took part in the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) have generally been unable to replicate observed rates of ice sheet melt. With the advent of the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), with a general increase in the equilibrium climate sensitivity, we here compare two versions of the global climate model EC-Earth using the regional climate model HIRHAM5 downscaling of EC-Earth for Greenland and Antarctica. One version (v2) of EC-Earth is taken from CMIP5 for the high-emissions Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario and the other (v3) from CMIP6 for the comparable high-emissions Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario. For Greenland, we downscale the two versions of EC-Earth for the historical period 1991-2010 and for the scenario period 2081-2100. For Antarctica, the periods are 1971-2000 and 2071-2100, respectively. For the Greenland Ice Sheet, we find that the mean change in temperature is 5.9° C when downscaling EC-Earth v2 and 6.8° C when downscaling EC-Earth v3. Corresponding values for Antarctica are 4.1° C for v2 and 4.8° C for v3. The mean change in surface mass balance at the end of the century under these high-emissions scenarios is found to be-290yr-1 (v2) and-1640 Gt yr-1 (v3) for Greenland and 420 Gt yr-1 (v2) and 80 Gt yr-1 (v3) for Antarctica. These distinct differences in temperature change and particularly surface mass balance change are a result of the higher equilibrium climate sensitivity in EC-Earth v3 (4.3 K) compared with 3.3 K in EC-Earth v2 and the differences in greenhouse gas concentrations between the RCP8.5 and the SSP5-8.5 scenarios. ©","","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; climate modeling; CMIP; downscaling; glacier mass balance; global climate; greenhouse gas; ice sheet; regional climate; sea level change; uncertainty analysis","F.

However, such land use changes may affect the global carbon cycle, possibly offsetting mitigation efforts. Here a fully coupled Earth System model EC-Earth was used to investigate the impact of a Saharan solar farm on the terrestrial carbon cycle, simulated with prescribed reduced surface albedo approximating the albedo effect of photovoltaic solar panels over the Sahara desert. The resulting changes to the carbon cycle were an enhancement of the carbon sink across Northern Africa, particularly around the Sahel but a simultaneous weakening of the carbon sink in the Amazon basin. This is observed through spatial pattern changes to the values of net biome production (NBP), more evident during Northern Hemisphere summer season. NBP changes are contributed by competing responses in the net primary production and heterotrophic respiration rates. These changes to carbon exchange correspond to a wetter and warmer climate occurring in Northern Africa and a drier and warmer climate in the Amazon, with stronger driving effects of precipitation. Due to these coupled responses and complex teleconnections, thorough investigation of remote impacts of solar farms are needed to avoid unintended consequences on the terrestrial carbon cycle. © 2023 The Author(s).

Astragalus adscendens is a valuable endemic plant. There is less information about the effect of climate change on Astragalus genus especially A. adscendens. In this study, we used the ensemble modeling based on seven species distribution models to predict the spatial distribution of A. adscendens. The presence of A. adscendens points was recorded from our field surveys in Chaharmahal-va-Bakhtiari province as a semi-arid part of Central Zagros, Iran between 2015 and 2016. The future projections were made for the year 2050 and 2070 with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios (4.5 and 8.5). Also, in this approach, species occurrence data (140 points), 19 bioclimatic predictors from HadGEM2-CC (Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model, version two - Carbon Cycle), MRI-CGCM3 (Meteorological Research Institute Coupled Global Climate Model Version three) and three physiographic variables were used. According to the ensemble model, 33.58% of the study area (548678 ha) was suitable for the A. adscendens. This research showed annual precipitation, Isothermality, temperature annual range and slope have played the most important role in habitat suitability of this species. The response curves showed that occurrence probability of A. adscendens mostly exists in habitats with annual precipitation from 380 mm to 630 mm, Isothermality from 35.7 to 36.8 (dimensionless), temperature annual range from 40.5 to 43°C and slope of 0.1 to 30 degree. The decline of suitable habitats will be 59.3% to 89.7% by 2050 and 2070. In contrast, 18.1% to 56.2% of currently unsuitable habitats can become suitable with climate changes. Evaluations showed that Random Forest was found to be the most reliable model for species prediction. Predicting the potential future changes in suitable habitat for A. adscendens will allow more reliable planning and management of this valuable species for experts. © 2021.

Our results show that in the EASM domain north of 25°N, the variation of the summer precipitation is dominated by precession, leading to strong 23-ky cycles, while the ice sheets only modulate the effect of insolation by influencing the land-sea pressure gradient.

Here we explore future GrIS evolution and interactions with global and regional climate under high greenhouse gas forcing with the Community Earth System Model version 2.1 (CESM2.1), which includes an interactive ice sheet component (the Community Ice Sheet Model v2.1 [CISM2.1]) and an advanced energy balance-based calculation of surface melt. We run an idealized 350-year scenario in which atmospheric CO2 concentration increases by 1% annually until reaching four times pre-industrial values at year 140, after which it is held fixed. The global mean temperature increases by 5.2 and 8.5 K by years 131–150 and 331–350, respectively. The projected GrIS contribution to global mean SLR is 107 mm by year 150 and 1,140 mm by year 350. The rate of SLR increases from 2 mm yr−1 at year 150 to almost 7 mm yr−1 by year 350. The accelerated mass loss is caused by rapidly increasing surface melt as the ablation area expands, with associated albedo feedback and increased sensible and latent heat fluxes. This acceleration occurs for a global warming of approximately 4.2 K with respect to pre-industrial and is in part explained by the quasi-parabolic shape of the ice sheet, which favors rapid expansion of the ablation area as it approaches the interior “plateau.”. © 2020.

In this study, we investigate how the mean state of the tropical atmosphere and the MJO respond to CRI intensity changes and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms, using the aquaplanet configuration in the Community Earth System Model, version 2 (CESM2). By enhancing CRI through tuning the DCS parameter (an autoconversion threshold size in the Morrison and Gettelman cloud microphysics scheme), we demonstrate that DCS-induced CRI intensification is linked to a warmer troposphere, increased tropical moisture, strengthened Hadley cell (HC), stronger trade winds, and a stronger equatorward intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) with more clouds and precipitation, reflecting stronger cloud–radiation–circulation feedback. The intensified CRI also leads to the intensification and slower propagation of the simulated MJO-like mode despite the MJO-like signals becoming less distinguishable from the background due to the influence of other waves. The MJO intensification is likely associated with the mean state changes that support the development of deep convection. Moreover, the CRI itself, especially the interaction with the longwave radiation, also directly influences the MJO’s maintenance and propagation, more contributing to the maintenance of column moist static energy (MSE) and deceleration of its eastward propagation on intraseasonal time scales. © 2024 American Meteorological Society.","Atmospheric circulation; Cloud microphysics; Cloud radiative effects; General circulation models; Madden-Julian oscillation","Drought; Atmospheric circulation; Cloud microphysics; Cloud radiative effects; Earth system modeling; General circulation model; Intensity change; Intraseasonal variability; Madden-Julian oscillation; Radiative interactions; Tropical atmospheres; cloud microphysics; cloud radiative forcing; general circulation model; Madden-Julian oscillation; tropical meteorology; Troposphere","X.

However, model evaluations usually lag behind the fast development of models, leading to a pervasive simulation uncertainty in key ecological processes, especially the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle. Traceability analysis provides a theoretical basis for tracking and quantifying the structural uncertainty of simulated C storage in models. Thus, a new tool of model evaluation based on the traceability analysis is urgently needed to efficiently diagnose the sources of inter-model variations on the terrestrial C cycle in Earth system models. Methods: A new cloud-based model evaluation platform, i.e., the online traceability analysis system for model evaluation (TraceME v1.0), was established. The TraceME was applied to analyze the uncertainties of seven models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Results: The TraceME can effectively diagnose the key sources of different land C dynamics among CMIIP6 models. For example, the analyses based on TraceME showed that the estimation of global land C storage varied about 2.4 folds across the seven CMIP6 models. Among all models, IPSL-CM6A-LR simulated the lowest land C storage, which mainly resulted from its shortest baseline C residence time. Over the historical period of 1850–2014, gross primary productivity and baseline C residence time were the major uncertainty contributors to the inter-model variation in ecosystem C storage in most land grid cells. Conclusion: TraceME can facilitate model evaluation by identifying sources of model uncertainty and provides a new tool for the next generation of model evaluation. © 2021, The Author(s).","CMIP6; land carbon cycle; model evaluation; traceability analysis; uncertainty","Carbon; Ecology; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Design and application; Gross primary productivity; Model uncertainties; Simulation uncertainty; Structural uncertainty; Traceability analysis; Uncertainty contributors; carbon cycle; carbon storage; CMIP; ecological modeling; primary production; residence time; terrestrial ecosystem; uncertainty analysis; Uncertainty analysis","J.

Its development is on the basis of the mediumresolution version BCC-CSM2-MR (T106 in the atmosphere and 1 latitude1 longitude in the ocean) which is the baseline for BCC participation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). This study documents the high-resolution model, highlights major improvements in the representation of atmospheric dynamical core and physical processes. BCC-CSM2-HR is evaluated for historical climate simulations from 1950 to 2014, performed under CMIP6-prescribed historical forcing, in comparison with its previous medium-resolution version BCC-CSM2-MR. Observed global warming trends of surface air temperature from 1950 to 2014 are well captured by both BCC-CSM2-MR and BCC-CSM2-HR. Present-day basic atmospheric mean states during the period from 1995 to 2014 are then evaluated at global scale, followed by an assessment on climate variabilities in the tropics including the tropical cyclones (TCs), the El Ni o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the stratosphere. It is shown that BCC-CSM2-HR represents the global energy balance well and can realistically reproduce the main patterns of atmospheric temperature and wind, precipitation, land surface air temperature, and sea surface temperature (SST). It also improves the spatial patterns of sea ice and associated seasonal variations in both hemispheres. The bias of the double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), obvious in BCC-CSM2-MR, almost disappears in BCC-CSM2-HR. TC activity in the tropics is increased with resolution enhanced. The cycle of ENSO, the eastward propagative feature and convection intensity ofMJO, and the downward propagation of QBO in BCC-CSM2-HR are all in a better agreement with observations than their counterparts in BCC-CSM2-MR. Some imperfections are, however, noted in BCC-CSM2-HR, such as the excessive cloudiness in the eastern basin of the tropical Pacific with cold SST biases and the insufficient number of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

In this study, potential inundation that can occur in the small archipelago of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea was modelled using the climate model projections. The methodology involved evaluating the performance of CMIP5 Global Climate Models (GCMs) in simulating the sea level rise in the Arabian Sea using various statistical methods. GFDL-ESM2G and MIROC5 were found to be the best performing models in predicting the sea level rise ranging from 0.4 mm year−1 to 0.9 mm year−1 under various RCP scenarios. Although the maximum sea surface height values for the period of 2080–2100 predicted by the models i.e., 0.78 m is less than the global sea level rise projected by the IPCC (0.8–2.0 m), it does not imply that the islands are safe from rising sea levels. The projections obtained from the best performing models were then used to map the potential inundation that may occur under RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 scenarios.

While ESMs are most often applied to century-long climate simulations, millennium-long simulations, which have been conducted by other types of models but not by ESM because of the computational cost, can provide basic fundamental properties of climate–C cycle models and will be required for estimating the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and subsequent climate stabilization in the future. This study used two ESMs (the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, the Earth system model version (MIROC-ESM) and the MIROC Earth system version 2 for long-term simulation (MIROC-ES2L)) to investigate millennium-scale climate and C cycle adjustment to external forcing. The CO2 concentration was doubled abruptly at the beginning of the model simulations and kept at that level for the next 1000 or 2000 years; these model simulations were compared with transient simulations where the CO2 was increased at the rate of 1% year−1 for up to 140 years (1pctCO2). Model simulations to separate and evaluate the C cycle feedbacks were also performed. Unlike the 1pctCO2 experiment, the change in temperature–cumulative anthropogenic C emission (∆T–CE) relationship was non-linear over the millennium time-scales; there were differences in this nonlinearity between the two ESMs. The differences in ∆T–CE among existing models suggest large uncertainty in the ∆T and CE in the millennium-long climate-C simulations. Ocean C and heat transport were found to be disconnected over millennium time-scales, leading to longer time-scale of ocean C accumulation than heat uptake. Although the experimental design used here was highly idealized, this long-lasting C uptake by the ocean should be considered as part of the stabilization of CO2 concentration and global warming. Future studies should perform millennium time-scale simulations using a hierarchy of models to clarify climate-C cycle processes and to understand the long-term response of the Earth system to anthropogenic perturbations.

We compared the responses of the hydrological cycle with different timescales between land and ocean within approximately 5 years after the eruption. On land, because of a decrease in shortwave radiation (SW) due to the volcanic forcing, evaporation and precipitation decreased immediately after the eruption, and also cloud cover decreased and worked to increase SW, contrary to the volcanic forcing. In the ocean, the decrease in precipitation was more pronounced after approximately a year after the eruption. Thus, we noted a clear land-ocean contrast in weakening the global average response of the hydrological cycle. The global mean gross primary production (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems has increased since the eruption. This increase is mainly due to the rise of tropical GPP, which was attributable to the reduced cloud cover caused by volcanic force. While the volcanic forcing decreased SW in most terrestrial areas, the reduced cloud cover contributed to the GPP increase through the increase in SW. The relationship between these responses highlights the importance of reducing uncertainty in Earth system models related to the response of the hydrological cycle, such as clouds, to reduce uncertainty in the carbon cycle's response to volcanic eruptions. © 2025.

This occurs because pCO2 is more responsive to seasonal changes in physics (including warming) and biology in an ocean that contains more Cant. A-pCO2 changes have the potential to alter annual ocean carbon uptake and contribute to the overall marine carbon cycle feedback. Using the GFDL ESM2M Large Ensemble and a novel analysis framework, we quantify the influence of Cant accumulation on pCO2 seasonal cycles and sea-air CO2 fluxes. Specifically, we reconstruct alternative evolutions of the contemporary ocean state in which the sensitivity of pCO2 to seasonal thermal and biophysical variation is fixed at preindustrial levels, however the background, mean-state pCO2 fully responds to anthropogenic forcing. We find near-global A-pCO2 increases of >100% by 2100, under RCP8.5 forcing, with rising Cant accounting for ∼100% of thermal and ∼50% of nonthermal pCO2 component amplitude changes. The other ∼50% of nonthermal pCO2 component changes are attributed to modeled changes in ocean physics and biology caused by climate change. Cant-induced A-pCO2 changes cause an 8.1 ± 0.4% (ensemble mean ± 1σ) increase in ocean carbon uptake by 2100. The is because greater wintertime wind speeds enhance the impact of wintertime pCO2 changes, which work to increase the ocean carbon sink. Thus, the seasonal ocean carbon cycle feedback works in opposition to the larger, mean-state feedback that reduces ocean carbon uptake by ∼60%. © 2022 The Authors.

We use three climate models provided by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under two representative concentration pathways scenario (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) to assess the trends and spatial behavior of six atmospheric and ocean variables in the Caribbean Basin during the twenty-first century. Atmospheric results are reported from the model ensemble; however oceanic results are reported from ACCESS1.0 model, as its resolution captures mesoscale processes which are important for regional sea level projections. Surface atmospheric pressure and wind do not show significant trends. On the contrary, air and sea surface temperature, surface salinity, and mean sterodynamic sea level have coherent positive trends in the Caribbean Basin, which increase with a greater RCP scenario. Air temperature will probably increase by 2 °C over the preindustrial period during the century. Moreover, sea surface temperature is expected to rise between 1.92° and 3.01 °C in the 1976–2005 to 2071–2100 period. The Caribbean Sea warming will have the potential to extend the hurricane season, increase the frequency of tropical storms, and intensify coral bleaching events. In the same period, mean sterodynamic sea level is expected to rise in the basin between 32.53 and 43.25 cm, depending on the RCP scenario used. The strongest trend expected in 2005-2100 is 50.84 ± 1.48 cm cy−1 under RCP8.5 scenario. Furthermore, the trends appear to accelerate since the last century in the basin. Besides, sterodynamic sea level rise would account for slightly over half of the total sea level rise in the Caribbean, after land-ice melting among other contributions not accounted by CMIP5 models are included. These trends have the potential to exacerbate flooding and erosion, putting at risk coastal areas, including low-elevation islands such as some in the San Andres and Providencia Archipelago. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Colombia basin; Mean sea level rise; San Andres and Providencia Archipelago","Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Sea; Colombia; Providencia Island; San Andres Island; San Andres y Providencia; Providencia; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Global warming; Sea level; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Adaptive capacity; Coastal communities; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Global warming impact; Mesoscale process; Sea surface temperature (SST); Spatial behaviors; Surface salinities; air temperature; atmospheric pressure; climate modeling; CMIP; coral bleaching; sea level change; sea surface temperature; twenty first century; warming; Climate models","D.F.

We analyse simulations of the Australian Earth System Model (ACCESS-ESM1.5) with a prescribed 1% yr-1 CO2 increase in three different configurations: (1) without nutrient limitation, (2) with nitrogen limitation only and (3) with nitrogen and phosphorus limitation combined. Our results suggest a reduction in land carbon uptake and feedback strength of about 30% by including nitrogen limitation only. This reduction agrees well with the ensemble mean of models with and without nitrogen limitation from the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). By adding phosphorus limitation to our model, the response is even stronger with a further 50% reduction for the carbon-concentration feedback and a further 75% reduction for the carbon-climate feedback. We find that the feedback strength in all three nutrient configurations is mostly determined by vegetation productivity (i.e. Net Primary Production) with little contribution from soil heterotrophic respiration. Our simulations show that nutrient limitation has the largest impact in the northern mid latitudes (around 50°), reducing land carbon uptake by about 50% when accounting for nitrogen and phosphorus limitation combined. The strong response of land carbon uptake and feedback strength to nutrients in our model simulations underlines the importance of including both nitrogen and phosphorus limitation in other Earth System Models in order to derive better estimates of future land carbon uptake and to assess the effectiveness of land-based carbon mitigation. © 2021 The Author(s).

We use the simulations of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1-BGC) forced with Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 to investigate climate-vegetation feedbacks from 1850 to the year 2300. Human-induced land use and land cover change (LULCC), through biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes, alter the climate and modify photosynthetic activity. The changing characteristics of extreme anomalies in photosynthesis, referred to as carbon cycle extremes, increase the uncertainty of terrestrial ecosystems to act as a net carbon sink. However, the role of LULCC in altering carbon cycle extremes under business-as-usual (continuously rising) CO2 emissions is unknown. Here we show that LULCC magnifies the intensity, frequency, and extent of carbon cycle extremes, resulting in a net reduction in expected photosynthetic activity in the future. We found that large temporally contiguous negative carbon cycle extremes are due to a persistent decrease in soil moisture, which is triggered by declines in precipitation. With LULCC and global warming, vegetation exhibits increased vulnerability to hot and dry environmental conditions, increasing the frequency of fire events and resulting in considerable losses in photosynthetic activity. While most regions show strengthening of negative carbon cycle extremes, a few locations show a weakening effect driven by declining vegetation cover or benign climate conditions for photosynthesis. Increasing hot, dry, and fire-driven carbon cycle extremes are essential for improving carbon cycle modeling and estimation of ecosystem responses to LULCC and rising CO2 mole fractions. Moreover, large aberrations in vegetation productivity represent potential and growing threats to human lives, wildlife, and food security. © 2022 Oak Ridge National Laboratory.","carbon cycle extremes; climate change; climate drivers; climate-carbon feedbacks; compound extremes; land use and land cover change","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate conditions; climate feedback; extreme event; global climate; land cover; land use change","B.

The DME and its variations have been observed in ice cores for paleoclimate studies; however, variations in present-day δatm(18O) have never been detected so far. Here, we present diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations of δatm(18O) based on observations at a surface site in central Japan. The average diurnal δatm(18O) cycle reached a minimum during the daytime, and its amplitude was larger in summer than in winter. We found that use of δatm(18O) enabled separation of variations of atmospheric δ( O2/N2) into contributions from biological activities and fossil fuel combustion. The average seasonal δatm(18O) cycle reached at a minimum in summer, and the peak-to-peak amplitude was about 2 per meg (1 per meg is 0.001 ‰). A box model that incorporated biological and water processes reproduced the general characteristics of the observed diurnal and seasonal cycles. A slight but significant secular increase in δatm(18O) by (0.22 ± 0.14) per meg a-1 occurred during 2013-2022. Secular changes in δatm(18O) were also simulated by using the box model considering long-term changes in terrestrial gross primary production (GPP), photorespiration, and δ(18O) of leaf water ( δLW(18O)). We calculated changes in δLW(18O) using a state-of-the-art, three-dimensional model, MIROC5-iso. The observed secular increase in δatm(18O) was reproduced by the box model that incorporated the isotopic effects associated with the DME from Bender et al. (1994), while the simulated δatm(18O) showed a secular decrease when the model incorporated the isotopic effects from Luz and Barkan (2011). Therefore, long-term observations of δatm(18O) and better understanding of the DME are indispensable for an application of δatm(18O) to constrain long-term changes in global GPP and photorespiration. © Author(s) 2025.","","Japan; annual variation; anthropogenic source; carbon cycle; diurnal variation; hydrological cycle; oxygen; seasonal variation","S.

However, current models lack full coupling of the ice sheets to the ocean and are typically run at a coarse resolution (1 °grid spacing or coarser). Coarse spatial resolution is particularly a problem over Antarctica, where sub-grid-scale orography is well-known to influence precipitation fields, and glacier models require high-resolution atmospheric inputs. This resolution limitation has been partially addressed by regional climate models (RCMs), which must be forced at their lateral and ocean surface boundaries by (usually coarser) global atmospheric datasets, However, RCMs fail to capture the two-way coupling between the regional domain and the global climate system. Conversely, running high-spatial-resolution models globally is computationally expensive and can produce vast amounts of data. Alternatively, variable-resolution grids can retain the benefits of high resolution over a specified domain without the computational costs of running at a high resolution globally. Here we evaluate a historical simulation of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) implementing the spectral element (SE) numerical dynamical core (VR-CESM2) with an enhanced-horizontal-resolution (0.25°) grid over the Antarctic Ice Sheet and the surrounding Southern Ocean; the rest of the global domain is on the standard 1 °grid. We compare it to 1 °model runs of CESM2 using both the SE dynamical core and the standard finite-volume (FV) dynamical core, both with identical physics and forcing, including prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice concentrations from observations. Our evaluation reveals both improvements and degradations in VR-CESM2 performance relative to the 1 °CESM2. Surface mass balance estimates are slightly higher but within 1 standard deviation of the ensemble mean, except for over the Antarctic Peninsula, which is impacted by better-resolved surface topography. Temperature and wind estimates are improved over both the near surface and aloft, although the overall correction of a cold bias (within the 1 °CESM2 runs) has resulted in temperatures which are too high over the interior of the ice sheet. The major degradations include the enhancement of surface melt as well as excessive cloud liquid water over the ocean, with resultant impacts on the surface radiation budget. Despite these changes, VR-CESM2 is a valuable tool for the analysis of precipitation and surface mass balance and thus constraining estimates of sea level rise associated with the Antarctic Ice Sheet.  © 2023 Copernicus GmbH.

Recent studies suggest that increasing tree cover can make a substantial contribution to negative emissions, with the tropics being the most suitable region from a biogeophysical perspective. Yet these studies typically do not account for subsequent carbon cycle and climate responses to large-scale land-use change. Here we quantify the maximum potential temperature and CO2 benefits from pantropical forest restoration, including the Earth system response, using a fully coupled, emission-driven Earth system model (HadGEM2-ES). We perform an idealised experiment where all land use in the tropics is stopped and vegetation is allowed to recover, on top of an aggressive mitigation scenario (RCP2.6).We find that tropical restoration of 1529 Mha increases carbon stored in live biomass by 130 Pg C by 2100 CE. Whilst avoiding deforestation and tropical restoration in the tropics removes 42 Pg C compared to RCP2.6, the subsequent reduction in extratropical and ocean carbon uptake means that carbon in the atmosphere only reduces by 18 PgC by 2100. The resulting small CO2 (9 ppm) benefit does not translate to a detectable reduction in global surface air temperature compared to the control experiment. The greatest carbon benefit is achieved 30–50 years after restoration before the Earth system response adjusts to the new land-use regime and declining fossil fuel use. Comparing our results with previous modelling studies, we identify two model-independent key points: (i) in a world where emission reductions follow the Paris Agreement, restoration is best deployed immediately, and (ii) the global carbon cycle response to reduced emissions limits the efficacy of negative emissions technologies by more than half. We conclude that forest restoration can reduce peak CO2 mid-century, but it can only modestly contribute to negative emissions.</p>. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

For climate models, AIS SMB provides a difficult challenge, as it is highly susceptible to spatial, seasonal, and interannual variability. Here we use a reconstructed data set of AIS snow accumulation as ""true"" observational data, to evaluate the ability of the CMIP5 and CMIP6 suites of models in capturing the mean, trends, temporal variability, and spatial variability in SMB over the historical period (1850-2000). This gives insight into which models are most reliable for predicting SMB into the future. We found that the best scoring models included the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) GISS model and the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Meteorology's model for CMIP5, as well as one of the Community Earth System Model v2 (CESM2) models and one MPI model for CMIP6. Using a scoring system based on SMB mean value, trend, and temporal variability across the AIS, as well as spatial SMB variability, we selected a subset of the top 10th percentile of models to refine 21st century (2000-2100) AIS-integrated SMB projections to 2274 ± 282 Gt yr-1, 2358 ± 286 Gt yr-1, and 2495 ± 291 Gt yr-1 for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, respectively. We also reduced the spread in AIS-integrated mean SMB by 79 %, 79 %, and 74 % in RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, respectively. Notably, we find that there is no improvement from CMIP5 to CMIP6 in overall score. In fact, CMIP6 performed slightly worse on average compared to CMIP5 at capturing the aforementioned SMB criteria. Our results also indicate that model performance scoring is affected by internal climate variability (particularly the spatial variability), which is illustrated by the fact that the range in overall score between ensemble members within the CESM1 Large Ensemble is comparable to the range in overall score between CESM1 model simulations within the CMIP5 model suite. We also find that a higher horizontal resolution does not yield to a conclusive improvement in score. © 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry.

By melting, the ice sheet thins, inducing higher surface melt due to lower surface elevations, accelerating the melt coming from global warming. This process is called the melt-elevation feedback and can be considered by using two types of models: either (1) atmospheric models, which can represent the surface mass balance (SMB), or SMB estimates resulting from simpler models such as positive degree day models or (2) ice sheet models representing the surface elevation evolution. The latter ones do not represent the surface mass balance explicitly as well as polar-oriented climate models. A new coupling between the MAR (Modèle Atmosphérique Régional) regional climate model and the PISM (Parallel Ice Sheet Model) ice sheet model is presented here following the CESM2 (Community Earth System Model; SSP5-8.5, Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) scenario until 2100 at the MAR lateral boundaries. The coupling is extended to 2200 with a stabilised climate (+7C compared to 1961-1990) by randomly sampling the last 10 years of CESM2 to force MAR and reaches a sea level rise contribution of 64cm. The fully coupled simulation is compared to a one-way experiment where surface topography remains fixed in MAR. However, the surface mass balance is corrected for the melt-elevation feedback when interpolated on the PISM grid by using surface mass balance vertical gradients as a function of local elevation variations (offline correction). This method is often used to represent the melt-elevation feedback and prevents a coupling which is too expensive in computation time. In the fully coupled MAR simulation, the ice sheet morphology evolution (changing slope and reducing the orographic barrier) induces changes in local atmospheric patterns. More specifically, wind regimes are modified, as well as temperature lapse rates, influencing the melt rate through modification of sensible heat fluxes at the ice sheet margins. We highlight mitigation of the melt lapse rate on the margins by modifying the surface morphology. The lapse rates considered by the offline correction are no longer valid at the ice sheet margins. If used (one-way simulation), this correction implies an overestimation of the sea level rise contribution of 2.5%. The mitigation of the melt lapse rate on the margins can only be corrected by using a full coupling between an ice sheet model and an atmospheric model.  © 2024 Copyright Authors","","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; atmospheric modeling; climate modeling; feedback mechanism; global warming; heat flux; ice sheet; sea level change","A.

Rather than modifying the cloud scheme itself, this study significantly ameliorates the marine stratus simulation through improving parameterizations of boundary-layer turbulence and shallow convection in the medium-resolution Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model version 2 (BCC-CSM2-MR). The University of Washington moist turbulence scheme is implemented in BCC-CSM2-MR to better represent the stratocumulus, and a decoupling criterion is also introduced to the shallow convection scheme for improving the simulation of the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition. Results show that the simulated precipitation in the eastern Pacific south of the Equator is largely reduced, alleviating the double ITCZ problem. The tropical precipitation asymmetry index increases from -0.024 in the original BCC-CSM2-MR to 0.147 in the revised BCC-CSM2-MR, which is much closer to the observation. The study suggests that improving parameterizations of boundary-layer turbulence and shallow convection is effective for mitigating the double ITCZ syndrome in CGCMs. © 2021 Yixiong Lu et al.","","Beijing [China]; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); atmospheric convection; boundary layer; climate change; general circulation model; intertropical convergence zone; precipitation (climatology); stratocumulus; turbulence","Y.

Net primary and export production are important pathways of carbon from the surface to the deep ocean where it is stored for millennia. Climate change can interact with marine ecosystems via changes in the ocean stratification and ocean circulation. In this study we use results from the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) to assess the effect of a changing climate on biological production and phytoplankton composition in the high latitude North Atlantic Ocean. We find a shift in phytoplankton type dominance from diatoms to small phytoplankton which reduces net primary and export productivity. Using a conceptual carbon-cycle model forced with CESM2 results, we give a rough estimate of a positive phytoplankton composition-atmospheric CO2 feedback of approximately 60 GtCO2/°C warming in the North Atlantic which lowers the 1.5° and 2.0°C warming safe carbon budgets. © 2022.

For both El Niño and La Niña, two 20-member ensembles are generated from initial states that are predisposed to evolve into ENSO events. For each ENSO phase, one ensemble is forced with the observed BB emissions during satellite-era ENSO events while the other is forced with a climatological annual cycle, with the responses to anomalous BB emissions estimated from interensemble differences. It is found that the regional responses to anomalous BB emissions occur mainly during boreal fall, which is also the time of the climatological seasonal maximum in emissions. Transient responses are identified in precipitation, clouds, and radiation in both the tropics and extratropics. At the onset of El Niño, these include increased precipitation in the northern branch of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and an enhancement of cloud albedo and amount across the Maritime Continent and eastern subtropical Pacific Ocean. Additional responses are identified through the course of El Niño and successive La Niña events, the net effect of which is to strengthen sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the eastern Pacific Ocean during El Niño and warm the tropical Pacific Ocean during La Niña. These responses improve the simulation of ENSO power, diversity, and asymmetry in CESM2. © 2024 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-land interaction; Biosphere-atmosphere interactions; Climate variability; ENSO; Wildfires","Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Pacific Ocean (Subtropical); Pacific Ocean (Tropical); Air quality; Precipitation (meteorology); Premixed flames; Tropics; Atmosphere-land interactions; Biomass burning emissions; Biosphere-atmosphere interactions; Climate variability; Earth system modeling; EL Nino; El Nino southern oscillation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation events; La nina; Wildfire; aerosol; air-sea interaction; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; biomass burning; climate forcing; climatology; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; emission inventory; ensemble forecasting; extratropical environment; intertropical convergence zone; La Nina; land-atmosphere interaction; sea surface temperature; tropical environment; wildfire; Atmospheric temperature","J.T.

In the past 10 years, estimation of CO2 fluxes from land and ocean using the earth system models (ESMs) and inverse modelling of in situ atmospheric CO2 data have also made significant progress. We attempt, for the first time, to evaluate the CO2 fluxes simulated by an earth system model (MIROC-ES2L) and the fluxes estimated by an inverse model (MIROC4-Inv) using in situ data by comparing with GOSAT and OCO-2 observations. Both MIROC-ES2L and MIROC4-Inv fluxes are used in the MIROC4-atmospheric chemistry transport model (referred to as ACTM_ES2LF and ACTM_InvF, respectively) for calculating total column CO2 mole fraction (XCO2) that are sampled at the time and location of the satellite measurements. Both the ACTM simulations agreed well with the GOSAT and OCO-2 satellite observations, within 2 ppm for the spatial maps and time evolutions of the zonal mean distributions. Our results suggest that the inverse model using in situ data is more consistent with the OCO-2 retrievals, compared with those of the GOSAT XCO2 data due to the higher accuracy of the former. This suggests that the MIROC4-Inv fluxes are of sufficient quality to evaluate MIROC-ES2L simulated fluxes. The ACTM_ES2LF simulation shows a slightly weaker seasonal cycle for the meridional profiles of CO2 fluxes, compared with that from the ACTM_InvF. This difference is revealed by greater XCO2 differences for ACTM_ES2LF vs GOSAT, compared with those of ACTM_InvF vs GOSAT. Using remote sensing–based global products of leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) over land, we show a weaker sensitivity of MIROC-ES2L biospheric activities to the weather and climate in the tropical regions. Our results clearly suggest the usefulness of XCO2 measurements by satellite remote sensing for evaluation of large-scale ESMs, which so far remained untested by the sparse in situ data.

However, the impact of these spatial trends has remained largely unexplored, despite potentially large consequences for the carbon cycle. To address this knowledge gap, we forced a customised arctic version of the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS with daily CMIP6 outputs from a global climate model (MRI-ESM2-0) under three climate scenarios. We find that snow depths increased the most in the coldest, northernmost regions, insulating the soil, which led to increased heterotrophic respiration and reduced carbon residence times. We emphasise the need for improved projections of future snow depth - in particular diverging trends across landscapes - to more accurately simulate the strength of Arctic-Boreal carbon feedbacks and their impact on global climate. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Arctic; Boreal Shield; Canada; climate change; climate modeling; depth; snow; soil carbon; trajectory; warming","A.

To assess the influence of TLP on fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) and other biogeochemical cycles, we construct TLP forcing fields based on global riverine suspended sediment data and then apply them to the Community Earth System Model, version 2 (CESM2) modified with the TLP ballasting effect term. Simulations forced by different concentrations of TLP transported in the surface ocean or along the bottom of continental shelves and slopes are conducted. When the TLP transports seaward along the bottom, simulated POC fluxes at 100 and 2,000 m decrease about 11% and 19%, respectively, for the global ocean, and about 9% and 12%, respectively, for the oceanic regions of continental margins. The initial abiotic ballast processes triggered by TLP input increase POC fluxes, causing additional removal and burial of dissolved iron in continental margins. This further enhances the accumulation of macronutrients in the upwelling regions and their advection transport to neighboring subtropical gyres, thus altering regional productivity when simulations reach quasi-equilibrium. When consider the impacts of TLP in simulations, the simulated POC flux exhibits an increase in subtropical gyres but a decrease in tropical Pacific and mid-high latitude regions. The present work highlights the importance of TLP in global biogeochemical cycles, suggesting that the amount of carbon sequestration might be overestimated without TLP in models. © 2024.

As the upper boundary conditions, water discharges in the outlet sections of river basins, calculated using the ECOMAG runoff formation model for conditions of changed climate, based on the data of the same climate models were set. Based on ensemble simulations, two main trends in changes in estuarine hydrodynamic factors were identified and analyzed: the sea level rise and the river runoff decrease. Scenarios of spring floods and summer–autumn low water seasons corresponding to different combinations of boundary conditions for the historical period are modeled, as well as for the most probable and most unfavorable hydrometeorological conditions of the mid-21st century.

However, modeling land-use impacts is still challenging because of model complexity and uncertainty. This study examined the results of simulations of land-use change impacts by the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, Earth System version 2 for long-term simulations (MIROC-ES2L) conducted under the Land-Use Model Intercomparison Project protocol. In a historical experiment, the model reproduced biogeophysical impacts such as decreasing trends in land-surface net radiation and evapotranspiration by about 1970. Among biogeochemical impacts, the model captured the global decrease of vegetation and soil carbon stocks caused by extensive deforestation. By releasing ecosystem carbon stock to the atmosphere, land-use change shortened the mean residence time of terrestrial carbon and accelerated its turnover rate, especially in low latitudes. Future projections based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathways indicated substantial alteration of land conditions caused primarily by climatic change and secondarily by land-use change. Sensitivity experiments conducted by exchanging land-use data between different future projection baseline experiments showed that, at the global scale, the anticipated extent of land-use conversion would likely play a modest role in the future terrestrial radiation, water, and carbon budgets. Regional investigations revealed that future land use would exert a considerable influence on runoff and vegetation carbon stock. Further model refinement is required to improve its capability to analyze its complicated terrestrial linkages or nexus (e.g., food, bioenergy, and carbon sequestration) to climate-change impacts.

Our study examines temperature, precipitation, and leaf area index (LAI) during the growing season in China, using data from eighteen ESMs part of the Sixth International Coupled Model Comparison Project (CMIP6). This analysis was underpinned by site observations and remote sensing data. We employed a multiple linear regression model to quantify the sensitivity of LAI to temperature and precipitation, aiming to evaluate the ability of the CMIP6 model to simulate the sensitivity of vegetation in geographical and climatic spaces. Ultimately, models demonstrating superior simulation performance were selected. Our results show that: (1) While most models can simulate the spatial distribution of temperature, precipitation, and LAI during the growing season, significant discrepancies are evident in their mean values and trend patterns. (2) Compared to observations, the simulation ability of LAI sensitivity to temperature and precipitation was more accurate for regions exhibiting positive sensitivity. It was observed that the sensitivity of vegetation in ecotone was greater than elsewhere in China. However, the magnitude and distribution of vegetation sensitivity across climate spaces showed considerable variance (i.e., the corresponding relationship with the climate field). (3) After extensive evaluations, CANESM5–CanOE, INM–CM5–0, IPSL–CM6–LR, and MPI–ESM1–2–LR demonstrated the best performance on simulations of vegetation sensitivity to climate during China’s growing season. © 2024 Science Press.

The climatic response to these changes is studied here with focus on the Southern Hemisphere monsoons, by performing an equilibrium experiment of the LIG at 127 ka with the Australian Earth System Model, ACCESS-ESM1.5, as part of the Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project 4 (PMIP4). Simulated mean surface air temperature between 40 and 60° N over land during boreal summer is 6.5 °C higher at the LIG compared to PI, which leads to a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and a strengthening of the North African and Indian monsoons. Despite 0.4 °C cooler conditions in austral summer in the Southern Hemisphere (0-90° S), annual mean air temperatures are 1.2 °C higher at southern mid-latitudes to high latitudes (40-80° S). These differences in temperature are coincident with a large-scale reorganisation of the atmospheric circulation. The ITCZ shifts southward in the Atlantic and Indian sectors during the LIG austral summer compared to PI, leading to increased precipitation over the southern tropical oceans. However, weaker Southern Hemisphere insolation during LIG austral summer induces a significant cooling over land, which in turn weakens the land-sea temperature contrast, leading to an overall reduction (20 %) in monsoonal precipitation over the Southern Hemisphere's continental regions compared to PI. The intensity and areal extent of the Australian, South American and South African monsoons are consistently reduced in LIG. This is associated with greater pressure and subsidence over land due to a strengthening of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell during austral summer. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

Although the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) showed improvements in a number of terrestrial carbon cycle benchmarks, relative to its predecessor, our analysis suggests that the interannual variability (IAV) in net terrestrial carbon fluxes did not show similar improvements. The model simulated low IAV of net ecosystem production (NEP), resulting in a weaker than observed sensitivity of the carbon cycle to climate variability. Low IAV in net fluxes likely resulted from low variability in gross primary productivity (GPP)—especially in the tropics—and a high covariation between GPP and ecosystem respiration. Although lower than observed, the IAV of NEP had significant climate sensitivities, with positive NEP anomalies associated with warmer and drier conditions in high latitudes, and with wetter and cooler conditions in mid and low latitudes. We identified two dominant modes of seasonal variability in carbon cycle flux anomalies in our fully coupled CESM2 simulations that are characterized by seasonal amplification and redistribution of ecosystem fluxes. Seasonal amplification of net and gross carbon fluxes showed climate sensitivities mirroring those of annual fluxes. Seasonal redistribution of carbon fluxes is initiated by springtime temperature anomalies, but subsequently negative feedbacks in soil moisture during the summer and fall result in net annual carbon losses from land. These modes of variability are also seen in satellite proxies of GPP, suggesting that CESM2 appropriately represents regional sensitivities of photosynthesis to climate variability on seasonal time scales. © 2021.

However, it remains unclear how much of this tropical bias is attributed to the extratropics and tropics itself, respectively. Applying the regional data assimilation (RDA) method, we follow up a previous study with a more advanced model of GFDL CM2.1 to quantify the influence of extratropical atmosphere on the double-ITCZ bias. Our study reveals that this tropical bias is influenced to a large extent by the extratropics between 208 and 308, with little impact from the extratropics poleward of 308. This vital role of subtropics in the double-ITCZ bias is likely determined by the meridional extent of Hadley circulation from zonal-mean perspective. Besides, the vital role of subtropics is also supported by wind–evaporation–SST feedback in the subtropical southeastern Pacific from a regional perspective. © 2023 American Meteorological Society.

Recent work developed a refined and comprehensive understanding of the observed hydroclimate that has yet to be explored in global circulation models. This study investigates the simulation of the Caribbean hydroclimate using a suite of station and gridded observational datasets, the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) at high (0.25 × 0.25°) and low (0.9 × 1.25°) resolution, CESM2 at low (0.9 × 1.25°) resolution, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP), and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research (GFDL-SPEAR). The simulated climatologies (1983–2014) of the annual rainfall cycle and total moisture fluxes, and climatological regressions of sea surface temperatures (SST), sea-level pressure (SLP), and zonal/meridional low-level winds onto indices of seasonal Caribbean rainfall totals are calculated to investigate inter-model differences and their comparison to observations. Generally, fully coupled CESM, GFDL-SPEAR-MED, and CMIP6 simulations underestimate precipitation across the Caribbean, with some improvements using high-resolution (< 0.5°) simulations. The underestimations are largest during the Early-Rainy Season (ERS; mid-April to mid-June). Coupled models also show a moisture divergence bias associated with a stronger/west-displaced North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH), a weaker / southward displaced Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and stronger Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ). Precipitation and large-scale dynamic biases in experiments with observation-based SSTs are smaller, regardless of their spatial resolution, suggesting SST biases in coupled models may contribute to precipitation and circulation biases. The findings emphasize the importance of both high-resolution and accurate simulation of coupled dynamical interactions in global circulation models to accurately simulate the Caribbean’s hydroclimate, and, therefore, provide reliable future climate projections for the region. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","AMIP; Caribbean rainfall; CESM; Climate; CMIP6; Dynamics; Fully coupled","Caribbean Islands; climate modeling; hydrometeorology; intertropical convergence zone; rainfall; resolution; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; spatial resolution","C.J.

We review the main improvements since the year 2012, mainly added modules for wild fires, carbon leaching through soil and transport of dissolved organic carbon to the ocean, and land cover changes but also improved representation of photosynthesis, respiration, and plant functional types. This version of ISBA-CTRIP is fully described in terms of land carbon pools, fluxes, and their interactions. Results are compared with the previous version in an off-line mode forced by observed climate during the historical time period. The two simulations are presented to demonstrate the model performance compared to an ensemble of observed and observation-derived data sets for gross and net primary productivity, heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration, above and below ground biomass, litter, and soil carbon pools. New developments specific to the new version such as burned area, fire emissions, carbon leaching, and land cover are also validated against observations. The results show clearly that the latest version of ISBA-CTRIP outperforms the former version and reproduces generally well the observed mean spatial patterns in carbon pools and fluxes, as well as the seasonal cycle of leaf area index. The trends of the global fluxes over the last 50 years agree with other global models and with available estimates. This comparison gives us confidence that the model represents the main processes involved in the terrestrial carbon cycle and can be used to explore future global change projections. ©2020.

Simulations of this SAI scenario with the CESM Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (CESM2-WACCM6) showed nearly unchanged interhemispheric and pole-to-Equator surface temperature gradients relative to present-day conditions around 2020, and reduced global impacts, such as heatwaves, sea ice melting, and shifting precipitation patterns (Tilmes et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-579-2020). However, model structural uncertainties can lead to varying climate projections under the same forcing. Implementing identical stratospheric aerosol radiative properties in GFDL-ESM4.1, which has a much lower Effective Climate Sensitivity compared to CESM2-WACCM6, resulted in a decrease in global-mean surface temperature by more than 1.5°C and a corresponding reduction in precipitation responses. Two major reasons contribute to the different temperature response between the two models: first, GFDL-ESM4.1 has less warming in the SSP534-OS scenario; second, GFDL-ESM4.1 has shown more pronounced cooling in response to the same stratospheric AOD perturbation. Notably, the Southern Hemisphere experiences substantial cooling compared to the Northern Hemisphere, accompanied by a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Furthermore, our analysis reveals that spatially heterogeneous forcing within the SAI scenario results in diverse climate feedback parameters in the GFDL-ESM4.1 model, through varying surface warming/cooling patterns. This research highlights the importance of considering model structural uncertainties and forcing spatial patterns for a comprehensive evaluation of future scenarios and geoengineering strategies. © 2024.

The model datasets have been submitted to the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) node. Here, the details of the experiments, the output variables and some baseline results are presented. Compared with the preliminary results of other models, the evolutions of global mean variables can be reproduced well by FGOALS-g3.

These changes lead to imbalances in climate systems as human activities such as greenhouse-gas emissions increase atmospheric gas concentrations. This situation affects the frequency and intensity of climate events worldwide, with floods being one of them. Floods manifest as water inundations due to factors such as changes in rainfall patterns, rising temperatures, erosion, and sea-level rise. These floods cause significant damage to sensitive areas such as residential areas, agricultural lands, river valleys, and coastal regions, adversely impacting people’s lives, economies, and environments. Therefore, flood risk has been investigated in decision-making processes in the Diyarbakır province using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method and future disaggregation of global climate model data. HadGEM-ES, GFDL-ESM2M, and MPI-ESM-MR models with RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were used. Model data were disaggregated using the equidistance quantile matching method. The study reveals flood-risk findings in the HadGEM-ES model while no flood risk was found in the GFDL-ESM2M and MPI-ESM-MR models. In the AHP method, flood risk analysis was conducted based on historical data across Diyarbakır and interpreted alongside future rainfall data. © 2024 The Authors.","analytical hierarchy method; climate change; climate model; data disaggregation; flood risk","Diyarbakir [Turkey]; Turkey; Decision making; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hierarchical systems; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Analysis method; Analytical hierarchies; Analytical hierarchy method; Analytical hierarchy process method; Data disaggregation; Flood event; Flood risks; Global climate changes; Human influences; Modeling data; analytical hierarchy process; climate change; climate modeling; decision making; flood damage; rainfall; risk assessment; Flood damage","B.

Its oceanic and atmospheric components carry heat from low to high latitudes thus reducing the equator-to-pole temperature contrast. In quasi-equilibrium climate states, changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) energy fluxes and ocean heat content remain small. In such conditions, anomalies in oceanic and atmospheric heat transport must have the same magnitude but opposite signs. This phenomenon is known as the Bjerknes compensation (BJC). The BJC hypothesis is of high importance in climate, since it imposes a strong constraint on climate variability at sufficiently long timescales (on sub-decadal and shorter timescales TOA flux variations may become comparable to other heat budget terms, interfering with BJC). However, to which extent BJC operates in the climate system and the key mechanisms of the compensation remain poorly understood. Here we analyze BJC in the IPSL-CM6A-LR climate model, focusing on its timescale dependence, its links to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and the connection to Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifts. We show that BJC occurs in the model at both multi-decadal and centennial timescales, but is stronger on centennial timescales than decadal. In both cases BJC is initiated by variations in ocean heat transport induced by AMOC variability that are partially or fully compensated by atmospheric heat transport. For decadal timescales, we find two regions of a strong BJC at latitudes associated with the storm track region and the marginal ice zone in the Northern Hemisphere. Finally, on centennial timescales we observe a Bjerknes-like interbasin compensation between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific heat transports, which is also related to strong centennial AMOC fluctuations and involves Southern Ocean zonal heat transport. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Atlantic meridional overturning circulation; Bjerknes compensation; Climate variability; Poleward heat transport","climate variation; decadal variation; heat transfer; intertropical convergence zone; meridional circulation; zonal wind","Y.

Here we calculated the strength of the interactions between the two responses using simulations of models participated in the phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). We found that the nonlinear interaction contributed 11% of the land–atmosphere carbon exchange on average with large intermodel variation (from −20% to +162%). This nonlinear interaction is largely driven by the pattern of net primary production (NPP), with shifts in heterotrophic respiration that dampen the overall positive interactions from NPP. Photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area alone cannot adequately explain a wide variation of interactions in global NPP simulated by CMIP6 models. Plant respiration and processes that regulate leaf area are also important contributors to the interactions. Dominant factors that induce carbon–concentration and carbon–climate interactions are highly variable among models. One of those dominant factors is nutrient limitation. Using additional simulations of ACCESS-ESM1.5 that include both nitrogen and phosphorus limitation, we found that the estimated interactions by ACCESS-ESM1.5 with or without nutrient limitations covered the large intermodel variations among the CMIP6 models. It remains largely unknown how nutrient limitation complicates ecosystem's responses to simultaneously CO2 fertilization and warming at the global scale. Our modeling results point to a potential important role of nutrients, especially phosphorus on the nonlinear interactions. Yet, more studies are needed on ecosystem responses to concurrent changes in nutrient availability, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and warming. © 2021 Commonwealth of Australia.

In particular, land biogeochemistry was extended to a wider set of carbon pools and plant functional types, along with a prognostic representation of the nitrogen cycle. The marine ecosystem representation was reshaped toward an intermediate complexity of lower trophic level interactions, including an interactive benthic compartment and a new formulation of heterotrophic bacterial population. Details are provided on the model setup and implementation for the different experiments performed as contribution to the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. CMCC-ESM2 shows an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.57°C and a transient climate response of 1.97°C which are close to the CMIP5 and CMIP6 multi-model averages. The evaluation of the coupled climate-carbon response in the historical period against available observational datasets show a consistent representation of both physical and biogeochemical quantities. However, the land carbon sink is found to be weaker than the current global carbon estimates and the simulated marine primary production is slightly below the satellite-based average over recent decades. Future projections coherently show a prominent global warming over the northern hemisphere with intensified precipitations at high latitudes. The expected ranges of variability for oceanic pH and oxygen, as well as land carbon and nitrogen soil storage, compare favorably with those assessed from other CMIP6 models. © 2022 The Authors.

However, regional sea level is expected to vary across ocean basins, superimposed by the influence of natural internal climate variability. Here, we address the detection of dynamic sea level (DSL) changes by combining the perspectives of a single and a multimodel ensemble approach (the 50-member CanESM5 and a 27-model ensemble, respectively, all retrieved from the CMIP6 archive), under three CMIP6 projected scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. The ensemble analysis takes into account four key metrics: signal (S), noise (N), S/N ratio, and time of emergence (ToE). The results from both sets of ensembles agree in the fact that regions with higher S/N (associated with smaller uncertainties) also reflect earlier ToEs. The DSL signal is projected to emerge in the Southern Ocean, Southeast Pacific, Northwest Atlantic, and the Arctic. Results common for both sets of ensemble simulations show that while S progressively increases with increased projected emissions, N, in turn, does not vary substantially among the SSPs, suggesting that uncertainty arising from internal climate variability has little dependence on changes in the magnitude of external forcing. Projected changes are greater and quite similar for the scenarios SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 and considerably smaller for the SSP1-2.6, highlighting the importance of public policies towards lower emission scenarios and of keeping emissions below a certain threshold. © 2021, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CMIP6; dynamic sea level; sea level rise; signal-to-noise; time of emergence","","B.

C3PS is based on the CNRM-ESM2-1 model including interactive aerosols and stratospheric chemistry schemes as well as terrestrial and marine biogeochemistry enabling a comprehensive representation of the global carbon cycle. C3PS operates through a seamless coupled initialization for the atmosphere, land, ocean, sea ice and biogeochemistry components that allows a continuum of predictions across seasonal to multiannual time-scales. C3PS has also contributed to the Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP-A) as part of the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Here we describe the main characteristics of this novel Earth system-based prediction platform, including the methodological steps for obtaining initial states to produce forecasts. We evaluate the entire C3PS initialization procedure with the most up-to-date observations and reanalyzes over 1960–2021, and we discuss the overall performance of the system in the light of the lessons learned from previous and actual prediction platforms. Regarding the forecast skill, C3PS exhibits comparable seasonal predictive skill to other systems. At the multiannual scale, C3PS shows significant predictive skill in surface temperature during the first 2 years after initialization in several regions of the world. C3PS also exhibits potential predictive skill in Net primary production (NPP) and carbon fluxes several years in advance. This expands the possibility of applications of forecasting systems, such as the possibility of performing multiannual predictions of marine ecosystems and carbon cycle. © 2024 The Author(s).

A single climate model realization may not represent forced change alone and may diverge from other realizations, as well as observations, due to ICV. We use an initial-condition large ensemble of simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) to show that ICV produces a range of outcomes in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Trends in gross primary production (GPP) from 1991 to 2020 differ among ensemble members due to the different climate trajectories resulting from ICV. We quantify how ICV imparts on GPP trends and apply our methodology to the observational record. Observed changes in GPP at two long-running eddy covariance flux towers are consistent with ICV, challenging the understanding of forced changes in the carbon cycle at these locations. A probabilistic framework that accounts for ICV is needed to interpret carbon cycle trends. © The Author(s) 2024.","","carbon cycle; climate modeling; climate variation; primary production","G.B.

To determine the climate-change-induced impacts, Mike 3 Flow Model FM was used to simulate hydrodynamic and transport processes in the Persian Gulf in both historical (1998–2014) and future periods (2081–2100). Historical simulation was driven by ERA-Interim data. A statistical approach was employed to modify the values and directions of the future wind field obtained from the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) scenarios derived from CMCC-CM model of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The numerical model was calibrated and validated using measured data. Results indicated that in the historical period, residence time ranged between values of less than a month in the Strait of Hormuz and 10 years in the semi-enclosed area close to the south of Bahrain. The changes in wind field based on RCP 8.5 scenario were found to be the most disadvantageous for the Persian Gulf's capacity to flush dissolved pollutants out. Under this scenario, residence time would be 17% longer than that of historical one. This is mainly because the change in the wind field is large enough to overwhelm general circulation, showing a relationship between the residence time and the residual circulation. Impact of change in the wind field according to RCP 4.5 scenario on the modeled residence time is negligible. The numerical outputs also showed that the sea-level rise would slightly decrease the current velocity, resulting in a negligible increase in residence time. The findings of this study are intended to support establishing climate-adaptation management plans for coastal zones of the studied area in line with sustainable development goals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Numerical modeling; Physical processes; Residence time; Sea-level rise; The Persian Gulf","Arabian Sea; Bahrain; Indian Ocean; Persian Gulf; Strait of Hormuz; Climate models; Coastal zones; Sea level; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; General circulation; Historical periods; Historical simulation; Impact of changes; Residual circulations; Statistical approach; Transport process; air-sea interaction; calibration; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; general circulation model; hydrodynamics; residence time; sea level change; transport process; article; Bahrain; climate change; coastal waters; controlled study; flushing; hydrodynamics; Persian Gulf; pollutant; retention time; sea level rise; simulation; sustainable development; Climate change","M.H.

Observations from global hydrographic surveys reveal the spatial and temporal evolution of the ocean inventory of anthropogenic carbon and suggest substantial decadal variability in historical storage rates. Here, we use a 100-member ensemble of an Earth system model to investigate the influence of external forcing and internal climate variability on historical changes in ocean anthropogenic carbon storage over 1994 to 2014. Our findings reveal that the externally forced, decadal changes in storage are largest in the Atlantic (2-4 mmol m−3 decade−1) and positive nearly everywhere. Internal climate variability modulates regional ocean anthropogenic carbon storage trends by up to 10 mmol m−3 decade−1. The influence of internal climate variability on decadal storage changes is most prominent at depths of ∼300 m and at the edges of the subtropical gyres. Internal variability in anthropogenic carbon in the extratropics has high spectral power on decadal to multi-decadal timescales, indicating that the approximately decadal repetitions of hydrographic surveys may produce storage change estimates that are heavily influenced by internal climate variability. © 2025 The Author(s).

Notable differences relative to the previous generation of GFDL ESM's include enhanced resolution of plankton food web dynamics, refined particle remineralization, and a larger number of exchanges of nutrients across Earth system components. During model spin-up, the carbon drift rapidly fell below the 10 Pg C per century equilibration criterion established by the Coupled Climate-Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP). Simulations robustly captured large-scale observed nutrient distributions, plankton dynamics, and characteristics of the biological pump. The model overexpressed phosphate limitation and open ocean hypoxia in some areas but still yielded realistic surface and deep carbon system properties, including cumulative carbon uptake since preindustrial times and over the last decades that is consistent with observation-based estimates. The model's response to the direct and radiative effects of a 200% atmospheric CO2 increase from preindustrial conditions (i.e., years 101–120 of a 1% CO2 yr−1 simulation) included (a) a weakened, shoaling organic carbon pump leading to a 38% reduction in the sinking flux at 2,000 m; (b) a two-thirds reduction in the calcium carbonate pump that nonetheless generated only weak calcite compensation on century time-scales; and, in contrast to previous GFDL ESMs, (c) a moderate reduction in global net primary production that was amplified at higher trophic levels. We conclude with a discussion of model limitations and priority developments. ©2020.

All simulations show a band of maximum precipitation eastward of the observed one and without typical NW-SE orientation. This displacement suggests models have trouble in reproducing the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Due to this and additional model problems in simulating the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), all models exhibit negative precipitation biases at the extreme northern SA, including Guianas, Suriname, and north of Brazil and positive precipitation biases at part of northeastern Brazil. For extreme northern SA, models, in general, underestimate intense precipitation and overestimate weak rainfall. Analysis of the moisture flux divergence over the northern coast of SA in models suggested that the precipitation bias could primarily stem from model misrepresentations of moisture availability for convection. Further analyses indicate that the moisture flux biases are, in turn, tied to a negative sea surface temperature (SST) bias in the tropical North Atlantic, inducing stronger northeasterly trade winds. Thus, more intense moisture flux goes to the inner continent. Consequently, an anomalous divergence of moisture flux and less precipitation occur near the coast. Despite some differences in energy budget and cloudiness, models results for wind, precipitation, SST, and latent heat flux suggest problems at WES feedback. In the GFDL-ESM and MIROC-ESM models, the negative SST bias was also partly associated with a lower incident shortwave (SW) radiation over the tropical North Atlantic. This SW bias was tied to a positive bias of cloud cover over tropical North Atlantic, at least in the GFDL-ESM. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","earth system models; precipitation bias; surface energy budget; tropical South America; WES feedback","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Budget control; Climate models; Heat flux; Moisture; Oceanography; Surface waters; Tropics; Austral summers; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Earth system model; Intense precipitation; Intertropical convergence zone; Northeastern Brazil; Sea surface temperature (SST); South atlantic convergence zones; atmospheric moisture; climate change; climate modeling; energy budget; intertropical convergence zone; numerical model; precipitation (climatology); summer; surface energy; Precipitation (meteorology)","F.C.

However, it is still unclear to what extent ENSO is influenced by the extratropics in observation. Now we assess this issue by applying the regional data assimilation (RDA) approach in an advanced model, the GFDL CM2.1. Our study confirms a strong extratropical impact on observed ENSO. Quantitatively, the extratropical atmospheric variability poleward of 208 explains 56% of the observed variance of ENSO and greatly influences;67% of observed El Niño events during 1969–2008. This extratropical impact is still significant even as far as poleward of 308. Furthermore, the impact from the southern extratropics is slightly stronger than that from the northern extratropics, partly caused by the Pacific ITCZ location north of the equator and different mixed-layer depth along the northern Pacific meridional mode (NPMM) and the southern Pacific meridional mode (SPMM). Our study further shows that all of three super El Niño events, those in 1972/73, 1982/83, and 1997/98, are influenced greatly by both hemispheric extratropics, with NPMM and SPMM interfering constructively, while most weak and moderate El Niño events are triggered by only one hemispheric extratropics, with NPMM and SPMM interfering destructively. Besides the extratropical Pacific influence on ENSO via NPMM/SPMM, the extratropics also has a potential impact on ENSO by influencing other tropical oceans and then by interbasin interactions. © 2024 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere–ocean interaction; ENSO; Extratropics; Tropical variability; Tropics","Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Pacific Ocean (Tropical); Climatology; Advanced modeling; Atmosphere-ocean interactions; Data assimilation; El Nino event; ENSO; Extratropical; Extratropical atmospheric variability; Extratropics; Mixed layer depths; Tropical variability; air-sea interaction; data assimilation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; extratropical environment; intertropical convergence zone; mixed layer; quantitative analysis; trigger mechanism; tropical meteorology; tropical region; Tropics","T.

One example is the direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic aerosols, which increase the local reflection of solar radiation back into space. The historic emission of sulfur dioxide, which peaked in the northern midlatitudes during the 1980s, has been proposed as a primary contributor to historic anomalies in cross-equatorial energy transport, as well as related processes such as a shift in the tropical rainband. In this study, we analyze simulations from the Community Earth System Model, version 2 (CESM2), large ensemble and single-forcing projects to better understand the forced response of PET to historical forcings. First, analysis of the single-forcing project reveals that the position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) responds in a nonlinear manner to greenhouse gas forcing in CESM2. This type of nonlinearity has been found previously in the context of the aerosol-only simulations in the CESM2 single-forcing project but may be the first identification of a similar effect in the greenhouse gas–only simulations. Second, through analysis of the full CESM2 large ensemble simulations, we find that anomalous heat transport occurred in both the atmosphere (through the mean meridional circulation and atmospheric eddies) and the oceans (through the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific sectors) due to a variety of related processes including the Hadley cells, the midlatitude storm tracks, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and the Pacific wind-driven subtropical gyre. © 2024 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Energy transport; ENSO; Extratropical cyclones; Hadley circulation; Ocean circulation","Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric radioactivity; Greenhouse effect; Luminescence; Tropical cyclone; Tropics; Atmosphere-ocean interactions; Earth system modeling; Energy-transport; ENSO; Extratropical cyclones; Forcings; Hadley circulation; Heat transport; Ocean circulation; Poleward energy transport; aerosol; air-sea interaction; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; extratropical cyclone; gyre; Hadley cell; heat transfer; intertropical convergence zone; meridional circulation; Hurricanes","M.R.

It is extremely important to investigate the interactions among atmospheric CO2, the physical climate system, and the carbon cycle of the underlying surface for a better understanding of the Earth system. Earth system models are widely used to investigate these interactions via coupled carbon-climate simulations. The Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model version 2 (CAS-ESM2.0) has successfully fixed a two-way coupling of atmospheric CO2 with the climate and carbon cycle on land and in the ocean. Using CAS-ESM2.0, we conducted a coupled carbon-climate simulation by following the CMIP6 proposal of a historical emissions-driven experiment. This paper examines the modeled CO2 by comparison with observed CO2 at the sites of Mauna Loa and Barrow, and the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) CO2 product. The results showed that CAS-ESM2.0 agrees very well with observations in reproducing the increasing trend of annual CO2 during the period 1850–2014, and in capturing the seasonal cycle of CO2 at the two baseline sites, as well as over northern high latitudes. These agreements illustrate a good ability of CAS-ESM2.0 in simulating carbon-climate interactions, even though uncertainties remain in the processes involved. This paper reports an important stage of the development of CAS-ESM with the coupling of carbon and climate, which will provide significant scientific support for climate research and China’s goal of carbon neutrality. © Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press 2023.","atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>; CAS-ESM; coupled carbon-climate simulation; emissions-driven CMIP6 experiment","","J.

Aerosols also scatter sunlight, which increases the fraction of diffuse radiation, increasing photosynthesis. There remains no clear conclusion whether the impact of aerosols on land carbon fluxes is larger through diffuse radiation change than through changes in other climate variables. In this study, we quantified the overall physical impacts of anthropogenic aerosols on land C fluxes and explored the contribution from each factor using a set of factorial simulations driven by climate and aerosol data from the IPSL-CM6A-LR experiments during 1850–2014. A newly developed land surface model which distinguishes diffuse and direct radiation in canopy radiation transmission, ORCHIDEE_DF, was used. Specifically, a subgrid scheme was developed to distinguish the cloudy and clear sky conditions. We found that anthropogenic aerosol emissions since 1850 cumulatively enhanced the land C sink by 22.6 PgC. Seventy-eight percent of this C sink enhancement is contributed by aerosol-induced increase in the diffuse radiation fraction, much larger than the effect of the aerosol-induced dimming. The cooling of anthropogenic aerosols has different impacts in different latitudes but overall increases the global land C sink. The dominant role of diffuse radiation changes found in this study implies that future aerosol emissions may have a much stronger impacts on the C cycle through changing radiation quality than through changing climate alone. Earth system models need to consider the diffuse radiation fertilization effect to better evaluate the impacts of climate change mitigation scenarios. © 2021.

We describe a six-tracer biogeochemistry module of steady-state phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics in Biogeochemistry with Light, Iron, Nutrients and Gas (BLING version 2) with particular emphasis on enhancements relative to the previous version and evaluate its implementation in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's (GFDL) fourth-generation climate model (CM4.0) with ¼° ocean. Major geographical and vertical patterns in chlorophyll, phosphorus, alkalinity, inorganic and organic carbon, and oxygen are well represented. Major biases in BLINGv2 include overly intensified production in high-productivity regions at the expense of productivity in the oligotrophic oceans, overly zonal structure in tropical phosphorus, and intensified hypoxia in the eastern ocean basins as is typical in climate models. Overall, while BLINGv2 structural limitations prevent sophisticated application to plankton physiology, ecology, or biodiversity, its ability to represent major organic, inorganic, and solubility pumps makes it suitable for many coupled carbon-climate and biogeochemistry studies including eddy interactions in the ocean interior. We further overview the biogeochemistry and circulation mechanisms that shape carbon uptake over the historical period. As an initial analysis of model historical and idealized response, we show that CM4.0 takes up slightly more anthropogenic carbon than previous models in part due to enhanced ventilation in the absence of an eddy parameterization. The CM4.0 biogeochemistry response to CO2 doubling highlights a mix of large declines and moderate increases consistent with previous models. © 2020.

Part of these modulations have been associated with the internal variability of the climate system, linked to changes in oceanic sea surface temperature. More recently, several studies have highlighted the influence of external forcings during the dry period in the 1980s and the recovery around the 2000s. In this work we evaluate the internally and externally driven decadal modulations of Sahel rainfall during the entire twentieth century using a set of 12 models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). We begin by proposing a physically based definition of Sahel rainfall that takes into account the southward bias in the location of the Sahelian ITCZ simulated by all the models. Our results show that the amplitude of the decadal variability, which is underestimated by most models, is mainly produced by the internally driven component. Conversely, the external forcing tends to enhance the synchrony of the simulated and observed decadal modulations in most models, providing statistically significant correlations of the historical ensemble mean with observations in 1/3 of the models, namely IPSL-CM6A-LR, INM-CM5-0, MRI-ESM2-0, and GISS-E2-1-G. Further analysis of the detection and attribution runs of the IPSL-CM6A-LR shows that anthropogenic aerosol dominate the decadal modulations of Sahel rainfall simulated by this model, suggesting that at least a part of the impact is ocean-mediated and operated through shifts in the ITCZ and the Saharan heat low. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.","Anthropogenic effects/forcing; Coupled models; Decadal variability; Internal variability; Monsoons; Tropical variability","Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Arid regions; Oceanography; Rain; Surface waters; Tropics; Anthropogenic effect/forcing; Anthropogenic effects; Coupled models; Decadal variability; External forcing; Forcings; Internal variability; Monsoon; Tropical variability; Twentieth century; aerosol; anthropogenic effect; CMIP; decadal variation; ensemble forecasting; intertropical convergence zone; monsoon; rainfall; semiarid region; twentieth century; Modulation","C.D.

The simulations are performed under the specified SSP2-4.5 CO2 concentration pathway. It is found that both the temperature stabilization target and the SO2 injection strategy have important effects on the global carbon sink. Relative to the SSP2-4.5 scenario, averaged over the last 20 years of our simulations (year 2050–2069), simultaneous multi-location SO2 injection causes an increase in cumulative land carbon uptake of 45 and 23 PgC, and an increase in cumulative ocean carbon uptake of 6 and 2 PgC for temperature stabilization targets of 0.5°C and 1.5°C respectively. For a temperature stabilization target of 1.0°C, SO2 injections increase land and ocean carbon sinks by 22–42 PgC and 4–7 PgC, respectively, depending on the strategies of SO2 injections (low latitude, mid-to-high latitude, and multi-objective injection). Relative to SSP2-4.5, by year 2069, SAI increases diagnosed cumulative CO2 emissions by 25–53 PgC (3%–6%), implying a decrease in atmospheric CO2 if SO2 injections were performed under a prescribed CO2 emission pathway. Stratospheric SO2 injections slow permafrost thaw, but do not restore permafrost to the previous extent at the same warming level for all injection strategies. An abrupt termination of SO2 injection weakens both the ocean and land carbon sink, and causes a rapid decline of permafrost extent. A gradual phaseout of SO2 injection slows sharp decline of permafrost and delays the rebound of carbon sink. © 2024.

While the biases within one fully coupled model GFDL CM2.1 are examined, the large-scale bias patterns are broadly common to CMIP5/6 models. We disentangle the individual contribution of regional sea surface temperature (SST) biases to the double-ITCZ bias pattern using a series of slab ocean model experiments. A previously suggested Southern Ocean warm bias effect in displacing the zonal-mean ITCZ southward is manifested in the northern Pacific ITCZ while having little contribution to the zonally elongated wet bias south of the equatorial Pacific. The excessive southern Pacific precipitation is instead induced by the warm bias along the west coast of South America. The Southern Ocean bias effect on the zonal-mean ITCZ position is diminished by the neighboring midlatitude bias of opposite sign in GFDL CM2.1. As a result, the northern extratropical cold bias turns out to be most responsible for a southward-displaced zonal-mean ITCZ. However, this southward ITCZ displacement results from the northern Pacific branch, so ironically fixing the extratropical biases only deteriorates the northern Pacific precipitation bias. Thus, we emphasize that the zonal-mean diagnostics poorly represent the spatial pattern of the tropical Pacific response. Examination of longitude-latitude structure indicates that the overall tropical precipitation bias is mostly locally driven from the tropical SST bias.

ScenarioMIP is one of the core MIP experiments in phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Considering future CO2, CH4, N2O and other gases’ concentrations, as well as land use, the design of ScenarioMIP involves eight pathways, including two tiers (tier-1 and tier-2) of priority. Tier-1 includes four combined Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) with radiative forcing, i.e., SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, in which the globally averaged radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere around the year 2100 is approximately 2.6, 4.5, 7.0 and 8.5 W m−2, respectively. This study provides an introduction to the ScenarioMIP datasets of this model, such as their storage location, sizes, variables, etc. Preliminary analysis indicates that surface air temperatures will increase by about 1.89°C, 3.07°C, 4.06°C and 5.17°C by around 2100 under these four scenarios, respectively. Meanwhile, some other key climate variables, such as sea-ice extension, precipitation, heat content, and sea level rise, also show significant long-term trends associated with the radiative forcing increases. These datasets will help us understand how the climate will change under different anthropogenic and radiative forcings. © 2021, The Authors.","CMIP6; coupled model; data description; FGOALS-f3-L; ScenarioMIP","","Y.

In this study, using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 dataset and historical experiment outputs from 24 models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and Phase 6 (CMIP5/CMIP6) spanning the 1980s and 1990s, the simulation capability of models for sea-level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) variability of the ACW is evaluated. It is shown that most models can capture well the 50-month period of the ACW. However, many simulations show a weak amplitude, but with various phase differences. Selected models can simulate SLP better than SST, and CMIP6 models generally perform better than the CMIP5 models. The best model for SLP simulation is the CanESM5 model from CMIP6, whereas the best model for SST simulation is the ACCESS1.3 model from CMIP5. It seems that the SST simulation benefits from the inclusion of both a carbon cycle process and a chemistry module, while the SLP simulation benefits from only the chemistry module. When both SLP and SST are taken into consideration, the CanESM5 model performs the best among all the selected models. © 2020 by the authors.","ACW; CMIP5 models; CMIP6 models; Evaluation; Model simulation","Antarctic Circumpolar Current; Southern Ocean; Climate models; Sea level; Surface waters; Antarctic circumpolar wave; Atmospheric pattern; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; Global climates; Phase difference; Sea level pressure; Sea surface temperature (SST); air-sea interaction; circumpolar current; climate modeling; numerical model; sea level pressure; sea surface temperature; weather forecasting; Weather forecasting","T.

The rainfall increase is hypothesized to be caused by enhanced local autumn insolation, but is also attributed to increased sea surface temperature in the Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) and/or weakened El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, we performed numerical experiments based on the output of the CCSM4 simulations and examined the underlining mechanisms of the enhanced rainfall and how they may have impacted the surrounding regions. Our numerical experiments, performed with the Community Atmospheric Model version 4 (CAM4), show that a wetter climate in the mid-Holocene, mainly during July, August, September, and October (JASO), is a direct response to stronger insolation rather than being chiefly impacted by a weaker magnitude of ENSO. The results reveal that stronger insolation can enhance rainfall over large islands through the convection-moisture positive feedback. However, the same mechanism acting over the warmer South China Sea (SCS) would instead reduce the convection over the large islands. On the other hand, the island convection suppresses oceanic convection by weakening the low-level southerly wind over the SCS. The suppressed convection over the SCS during the mid-Holocene weakens the local Hadley circulation, but without dramatically shifting the latitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Convection-moisture feedback mechanism; El Nino Southern Oscillation; Insolation; Maritime Continent; Mid-holocene hydroclimate; Sea surface temperature","Borneo; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; feedback mechanism; Hadley cell; Holocene; insolation; intertropical convergence zone; oceanic convection; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; rainfall; sea surface temperature; warm pool","Y.S.

In this simulation, the SMB calculation is coupled with the atmospheric model, using a physically based surface energy balance scheme for melt, explicit calculation of snow albedo, and a realistic treatment of polar snow and firn compaction. By the end of the simulation (years 131–150), the SMB decreases with 994 Gt yr−1 with respect to the pre-industrial SMB, which represents a sea-level rise contribution of 2.8 mm yr−1. For a threshold of 2.7-K global temperature increase with respect to pre-industrial, the rate of expansion of the ablation area increases, the mass loss accelerates due to loss of refreezing capacity and accelerated melt, and the SMB becomes negative 6 years later. Before acceleration, longwave radiation is the most important contributor to increasing energy for melt. After acceleration, the large expansion of the ablation area strongly reduces surface albedo. This and much increased turbulent heat fluxes as the GrIS-integrated summer surface temperature approaches melt point become the major sources of energy for melt. ©2020.

The focus is on an in-depth understanding of the atmospheric dynamical processes that influence the HC subsiding edge. Two sets of experiments were performed: one utilizing the default OSA, and the other employing the comprehensive OSA that accounts for realistic physical mechanisms. The results show that implementing the comprehensive OSA simulates an El Niño-like warming pattern in reference to the default experiment, which leads to an HC contraction. Examination of zonal mean momentum dynamics in the upper troposphere reveals that variations in meridional winds, crucial for determining the HC extent, are primarily driven by the differences in the horizontal eddy momentum flux derivative. The findings indicate that the equatorward shift in meridional temperature gradients enhances subtropical zonal winds and baroclinicity along their equatorial flanks, amplifying equatorward-propagating Rossby waves. This, in turn, alters the eddy momentum flux, reshaping the pattern of the derivatives of horizontal eddy momentum flux, constraining meridional winds, and resulting in the equatorward movement of the HC subsiding edge. A scaling theory further supports the results of the HC contraction, showing that the increased subtropical zonal winds and the equatorward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) elevate the atmospheric angular momentum and eventually limit the expansion of the HC. © 2024 The Author(s).","El Niño-like SST pattern; Hadley Cell contraction; ocean surface albedo; tropical zonal mean atmospheric dynamics","air-sea interaction; albedo; El Nino; Hadley cell; meridional circulation; tropical environment; winter","J.

In this study, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, namely, Preference Ranking Organisation Method of Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE-II), Elimination Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE-II), and compromise programming, were used to identify appropriate GCMs whose projections can be used to downscale sea level projections at Ernakulam, Kerala, India. Support vector machine was employed to statistically downscale the sea level projections from the projections of GCMs. Five statistical metrics, namely, correlation coefficient (r), normalized root mean square error, absolute normalized average bias, mean absolute relative error, and skill score, were adopted in this study as the performance criteria. The weightage of each criterion was computed using the entropy method.

In this paper, the spatial distribution, dynamic change, and comparison with observed values of root bio-mass of 14 ESMs simulated historical experiments were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The global distribution of multi-year average from 1850 to 2005 of root biomass indicated that 7 ESMs had maximum or minimum values, while the rest ESMs showed that root biomass was higher in the middle and high latitudes of the equator and the northern hemisphere. The root biomass distribution at different latitudes showed that 40°S is also one of the high value areas; (2) The simulation results from 1995 to 2005 are compared with the site observation data (1990-2010) in different climatic zones by using SS index, the result showed deviations are relatively large but the simulation effect of temperate zone is slightly better than frigid zone and tropical zone. On the global scale, BCC-CSM2-MR is the best simulated ESM; (3) In the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, ESMs can reasonably simulate the seasonal variation over the years 1850 to 2005 of root biomass, but the relationship between interan-nual variation of the simulated root biomass and the meteorological factors (temperature, precipitation) by different ESMs is different. In order to conduct more precise and in-depth research and analysis, in addition to improving the model, it is also necessary to improve the collection of observational data. © 2023 Plateau Meteorology.

Surface fine dust was found to decrease by ∼0.23 μg m-3 with a unit decrease in SPEI in the SEUS, as opposed to an increase of ∼0.12 μg m-3 in the west. The anomalies of dust elemental ratios, satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), and dust extinction coefficients suggest that both the emissions and trans-Atlantic transport of African dust are weakened when the SEUS is under droughts. Through the teleconnection patterns of the negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a lower-than-normal and more northeastward displacement of the Bermuda High (BH) is present during SEUS droughts, which results in less dust being transported into the SEUS. At the same time, enhanced precipitation in the Sahel associated with the northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) leads to lower dust emissions therein. Of the 10 selected models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), GISS-E2-1-G was found to perform the best in capturing the drought-dust sensitivity in the SEUS. This study reveals the mechanism of how droughts influence aerosol abundance through changing long-range transport of dust.  © 2022 Wei Li.","","United States; aerosol; climate modeling; CMIP; computer simulation; drought; dust; emission inventory; evapotranspiration; hydrometeorology; intertropical convergence zone; long range transport; North Atlantic Oscillation; precipitation (climatology); spatial distribution","Y.

This study investigates the radiative effects of CO2 and anthropogenic aerosols on regional variations in the intensity of tropical meridional (Hadley-like) and zonal (Walker-like) overturning circulations, based on a suite of experiments using the IITM Earth System Model (IITM-ESM) along with supplementary analysis of observed and reanalysis datasets. Two key findings emerge from our study (i) strengthening of the Pacific Walker circulation with enhanced zonal sea surface temperature gradients and precipitation increase over the tropical Indo-Pacific, in response to global warming via ocean-atmosphere coupled feedbacks (ii) aerosol-induced intensification of regional meridional overturning circulation over the ( 0 − 120 ∘ E) longitudinal domain resulting from inter-hemispheric energy imbalance and southward shift of the southern hemispheric (SH) rainfall belt extending eastward from Africa across the Indian Ocean. Our results suggest that the combined radiative influence of increased CO2 and northern hemispheric (NH) anthropogenic aerosols reinforces the regional meridional overturning circulation, by enhancing convection over the SH and promoting widespread descent over the NH subtropics and mid-latitudes covering northern Africa, Mediterranean, parts of middle-East, West and South Asia.

Before any implementation of geoengineering, however, the complex natural responses and consequences of such methods should be fully understood to avoid any unexpected and potentially degrading impacts. Here we assess the changes in ecosystem carbon exchange and storage among different terrestrial biomes under three aerosol-based radiation management methods with the baseline of RCP8.5 using an Earth system model (NorESM1-ME). All three methods used in this study (stratospheric aerosol injection, marine sky brightening, cirrus cloud thinning) target the global mean radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere to reach that of the RCP4.5 scenario. The three radiation management (RM) methods investigated in this study show vastly different precipitation patterns, especially in the tropical forest biome. Precipitation differences from the three RM methods result in large variability in global vegetation carbon uptake and storage. Our findings show that there are unforeseen regional consequences under geoengineering, and these consequences should be taken into account in future climate policies as they have a substantial impact on terrestrial ecosystems. Although changes in temperature and precipitation play a large role in vegetation carbon uptake and storage, our results show that CO2fertilization also plays a considerable role. We find that the effects of geoengineering on vegetation carbon storage are much smaller than the effects of mitigation under the RCP4.5 scenario (e.g., afforestation in the tropics). Our results emphasize the importance of considering multiple combined effects and responses of land biomes while achieving the global temperature targets of the Paris Agreement. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

Ample evidence from the Northern Hemisphere suggests a mid- to late Holocene southward migration of the ITCZ. Such a shift would be expected to increase precipitation over semi-arid northern NE Brazil (Southern Hemisphere). However, the most robust precipitation record from northern NE Brazil shows a drying trend throughout the Holocene. Here, we address this issue presenting a high-temporal resolution reconstruction of precipitation over northern NE Brazil based on data from a marine sediment core, together with analyses of mid- and late Holocene simulations performed with the fully coupled climate model FGOALS-s2. Both, our data and the climate model simulations show a decrease in precipitation over northern NE Brazil from the mid- to the late Holocene. The model outputs further indicate a latitudinal contraction of the seasonal migration range of the ITCZ that, together with an intensification of the regional Walker circulation, were responsible for the mid- to late Holocene changes in precipitation over NE South America. Our results reconcile apparently conflicting precipitation records and climate mechanisms used to explain changes in precipitation over NE South America. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

However, many of these studies rely on models for which the errors are not yet fully understood over a region. This may have a considerable impact on the economic growth of the country if the model’s future predictions are used for studying long-term trends. Here we examined the spatial distribution of past, present, and future predictions of SM studied using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase5 (CMIP5) simulations for the historical period (1850–2005) and future climate projections (2006–2099) based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP-RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). Furthermore, the performance of modeled SM with the satellite AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth observation system) was studied. The modeled SM variations of 38 Global Climate Models (GCMs) show discreteness but still we observed that CESM1-CM5, CSIRO-MK3-6-0, BCC-CSM1-1, and also BCC-CSM1-1-M, NorESM1-M models performed better spatially as well as temporally in all future scenarios. However, from the spatial perspective, a large deviation was observed in the interior peninsula during the monsoon season from model to model. In addition, the spatial distribution of trends was highly diversified from model to model, while the Taylor diagram presents a clear view of the model’s performance with observations over the region. Skill score statistics also give the accuracy of model predictions in comparison with observations. The time series was estimated for the future trend of the SM along with the past few decades, whereas the preindustrial and industrial period changes were involved. Significant positive anomaly trends are noticed in the whole time series of SM during the future projection period of 2021–2099 using CMIP5 SM model datasets. © 2022 by the authors.

Here, using the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) under different CO2 emission rates, we find a pronounced weakening of ocean CO2 uptake in the Subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA), distinct from the global response. Initially, the SPNA is an effective CO2 sink, but due to the contraction of deep convection, the uptake decreases and the oceanic pCO2 exceeds the global average. Recognizing the importance of regional ocean circulation in CO2 uptake, we identify a nonlinear relationship between environmental conditions and uptake response, revealing consistent thresholds for the emergence of uptake weakening. These findings are also reproduced in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, confirming their robustness. Overall, the distinct uptake response reflects the key role of regional dynamics in regulating the CO2 budget and geochemical environment, which is important for regional CO2 mitigation strategies. © The Author(s) 2025.","","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); carbon dioxide; biogeochemical cycle; biological uptake; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; CMIP; environmental conditions; global warming; alkalinity; Article; budget; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide emission; carbon dioxide tension; carbon sink; climate; climate change; climate model; controlled study; critical value; decomposition; environmental factor; geochemical analysis; greenhouse; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; ocean circulation; rebound; sea; sea surface temperature; steady state; surface property; thermodynamics; article; carbon dioxide emission; carbon dioxide tension; diagnosis; greenhouse effect","Y.

Even though positive slopes in the productivity curves are constantly perceptible, the demands for arable land are evolving wildly, inevitably promoting deforestation actions and deleterious effects on the natural biogeochemical cycles, such as the carbon cycle. Several environmental models are used to explain these complex phenomena, whose variables change spatially and temporally as a function of economic, social and natural factors. Therefore, this study aimed at prospecting the soybean cultivation area using a territorial dynamics model (Dinamica EGO), in regions where sustainable use conservation units are located in the Tocantins state, considering different climate risk scenarios based on the water requirement satisfaction indexes (WRSI), calculated using daily average rainfall and temperature data from the MIROC5 global climate model. The WRSI contributed to a greater exploitation of natural resources around the environmental preservation areas of Ilha do Bananal/ Cantão, Lago de Palmas and Serra do Lajeado. Furthermore, a possible decrease in the soybean area in some recognized producing centers was prospected, as well as a scenario of greater distancing of this species cultivated areas, in a near future, from the mosaic of conservation units of Jalapão, which has become of high climatic risk for the soybean grain yields usually demanded by the market. © 2022, Universidade Federal De Goias (UFG).

MARBL is a component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM); it supports flexible ecosystem configuration of multiple phytoplankton and zooplankton functional types; it is also portable, designed to interface with multiple ocean circulation models. Here, we present scientific documentation of MARBL, describe its configuration in CESM2 experiments included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 (CMIP6), and evaluate its performance against a number of observational data sets. The model simulates present-day air-sea CO2 flux and many aspects of the carbon cycle in good agreement with observations. However, the simulated integrated uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is weak, which we link to poor thermocline ventilation, a feature evident in simulated chlorofluorocarbon distributions. This also contributes to larger-than-observed oxygen minimum zones. Moreover, radiocarbon distributions show that the simulated circulation in the deep North Pacific is extremely sluggish, yielding extensive oxygen depletion and nutrient trapping at depth. Surface macronutrient biases are generally positive at low latitudes and negative at high latitudes. CESM2 simulates globally integrated net primary production (NPP) of 48 Pg C yr−1 and particulate export flux at 100 m of 7.1 Pg C yr−1. The impacts of climate change include an increase in globally integrated NPP, but substantial declines in the North Atlantic. Particulate export is projected to decline globally, attributable to decreasing export efficiency associated with changes in phytoplankton community composition. © 2021 The Authors.

The fully coupled models differ primarily in the configuration and version of their atmosphere components (including the aerosol scheme), with smaller differences in their sea-ice and land model versions. Additionally, ACCESS-ESM1.5 includes biogeochemistry in the land and ocean components and can be run with an interactive carbon cycle. CMIP6 comprises core experiments and associated thematic Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs). This paper provides an overview of the CMIP6 submission, including the methods used for the preparation of input forcing datasets and the post-processing of model output, along with a comprehensive list of experiments performed, detailing their initialisation, duration, ensemble number and computational cost. A small selection of model output is presented, focusing on idealised experiments and their variants at global scale. Differences in the climate simulation of the two coupled models are highlighted. ACCESS-CM2 produces a larger equilibrium climate sensitivity (4.7°C) than ACCESS-ESM1.5 (3.9°C), likely a result of updated atmospheric parameterisation in recent versions of the atmospheric component of ACCESS-CM2. The idealised experiments run with ACCESS-ESM1.5 show that land and ocean carbon fluxes respond to both changing atmospheric CO2 and to changing temperature. ACCESS data submitted to CMIP6 are available from the Earth System Grid Federation (https://doi.org/10.22033/ESGF/CMIP6.2281 and https://doi.org/10.22033/ESGF/CMIP6.2288).

In this study, we evaluate the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and 6 models based on the position of the ITCZ in the South Atlantic during the period in which it is climatologically further south (February–May). This period characterizes the rainy season of the Brazilian semiarid. The models were ranked according to two objective methods and validated through a qualitative analysis. The first method considered a success rate to evaluate the correct position of the areas with maximum precipitation and minimum pressure and meridional wind as representative of the mean position of the ITCZ. Among the 15 coupled GCMs analysed for each CMIP, those that best represented the position of the ITCZ were HADGEM.2-AO, MIROC5 and CANESM2 from CMIP5 and CESM2 and MIROC6 from CMIP6. These models represented well the following characteristics of the ITCZ in February–May: maximum precipitation near the equator at the height of the coast of South America and with the wind convergence zone sloping north towards the African continent. The most common problem noticed in the other GCMs was to displace the ITCZ to the south of its observed mean position within the period February–May. Also, some GCMs presented a double ITCZ (GISS-E2-H, GDFL-CM3 and IPSL-CM5A-LR from CMIP5 and INM-CM5-0 from CMIP6) following two high TSM cores. One GCM (ACCESS1-3 from CMIP5) presented a relatively good performance, but the zone of greater precipitation was shifted to the east, being located in the centre of the Atlantic basin. Knowing how the GCMs represent the ITCZ is a criterion that must be considered when choosing the GCMs for climate change studies. © 2024 Royal Meteorological Society.","CMIP5; CMIP6; double ITCZ bias; evaluation of climate models; GCM; Intertropical Convergence Zone","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Climate change; Climate projection; CMIP5; CMIP6; Double intertropical convergence zone bias; Evaluation of climate model; General circulation model; Intertropical convergence zone; South Atlantic; Uncertainty; climate modeling; CMIP; general circulation model; intertropical convergence zone; numerical model; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; semiarid region; weather forecasting; Climate models","S.I.

Described in this paper are the main features of CanAM5, with a focus on changes relative to the last major scientific version of the model (CanAM4). These changes are mostly related to improvements in radiative transfer, clouds, and aerosol parameterizations, as well as a major upgrade of the land surface and land carbon cycle models and addition of a small lake model. In addition to changes to parameterizations and models, changes in the adjustable parameters between CanAM4 and CanAM5 are documented. Finally, the mean climatology simulated by CanAM5 for the present day is evaluated against observations and compared with that simulated by CanAM4. Although many of the aspects of the simulated climate are similar between CanAM4 and CanAM5, there is a reduction in precipitation and temperature biases over the Amazonian basin, global cloud fraction biases, and solar and thermal cloud radiative effects, all of which are improvements relative to observations.  © Copyright: ","","aerosol; air temperature; atmospheric modeling; carbon cycle; land surface; parameterization; precipitation (climatology); radiative transfer","J.N.S.

The current version, ACCESS-ESM1.5, has been mainly developed to enable Australia to participate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with an ESM version. Here we describe the model components and changes to the previous version, ACCESS-ESM1. We use the 500-year pre-industrial control run to highlight the stability of the physical climate and the carbon cycle. The long spin-up, negligible drift in temperature and small pre-industrial net carbon fluxes (0.02 and 0.08 PgC year-1 for land and ocean respectively) highlight the suitability of ACCESS-ESM1.5 to explore modes of variability in the climate system and coupling to the carbon cycle. The physical climate and carbon cycle for the present day have been evaluated using the CMIP6 historical simulation by comparing against observations and ACCESS-ESM1. Although there is generally little change in the climate simulation from the earlier model, many aspects of the carbon simulation are improved. An assessment of the climate response to CO2 forcing indicates that ACCESS-ESM1.5 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.87°C. © 2020 Journal Compilation BoM 2020 Open Access.","ACCESS; biogeochemistry; CABLE; carbon cycle; climate modelling; CMIP6; earth system modelling","carbon cycle; climate forcing; climate modeling; CMIP; numerical model; satellite data; satellite imagery; sensitivity analysis; weather forecasting","T.

Studies to investigate the origin of this bias mainly focused on the tropics itself. Applying the regional data assimilation method in the GFDL CM2.1 model, we investigate the combined and respective influences of the northern and southern extratropics on this bias. It is found that the reversed zonal SST gradient bias is caused to a considerable extent by the extratropical atmosphere, especially by the northern extratropics. This extratropical impact on the equator occurs mainly through influencing the Hadley circulation. Therefore, the ITCZ position in boreal spring in this model most likely determines the dominant role of northern extratropics in the spring equatorial westerly bias and additionally the zonal SST gradient bias. Due to the cold bias in the extratropical atmosphere, the northward shift of the ITCZ coupled with the increased meridional SST gradient caused by assimilating the northern extratropics strengthens the cross-equatorial southeasterly wind, thus correcting the spring equatorial westerly bias. The strengthened spring equatorial easterlies further steepen the thermocline slope and enhance the eastern upwelling, thus reproducing the summer cold tongue and finally improving the annual-mean zonal SST gradient bias. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.","Atlantic Ocean; Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Bias; Climate models; Climatology; Data assimilation; Extratropics; Ocean dynamics; Tropics","Atlantic Ocean; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate models; Oceanography; Surface waters; Atlantic Ocean; Atmosphere-ocean interactions; Bias; Data assimilation; Data assimilation methods; Extratropical; Extratropics; Hadley circulation; Ocean dynamics; Sea Surface Temperature gradients; air-sea interaction; climate modeling; climatology; data assimilation; gradient analysis; intertropical convergence zone; sea surface temperature; Tropics","T.

SAI operates by intervening in the radiative energy balance of the Earth system, exerting a temporary direct cooling effect on the climate. However, SAI also indirectly affects global temperature through its impact on atmospheric CO2 levels by influencing the natural carbon uptake efficiency. Most previous research on the carbon cycle under SAI suggests that continuous injections enhance the uptake of carbon, implying a larger number of allowable emissions for a given temperature target relative to a simulation without SAI. However, there are considerable uncertainties regarding the extent and timeline of facilitation or inhibition of atmospheric carbon removal under SAI. In this study, we evaluate the extent of change in negative emission burden (NEB) over the entire trajectory of a peak-shaving SAI deployment (SSP534-sulfur) compared to the baseline overshoot pathway (SSP534-over) that does not involve SAI. We run the SSP534-over scenario on the CNRM-ESM2-1 Earth system model from 2015 to 2249 and compare it to the simulation where, under SSP534-over conditions, SAI is used to maintain 2 °C warming (SSP534-sulfur). The results indicate that carbon effects are reinforced under SAI. While the land carbon reservoir is a carbon sink, SAI enhances the uptake further; when the land acts as a carbon source, SAI enhances the outgassing. Thereby, carbon fluxes associated with SAI evolve over time: the increase in carbon uptake under SAI during the positive emission phase confirms prior studies and substantiates the concept of buying time during SAI ramp-up; later stages of the peak-shaved SAI scenario show the carbon benefit reducing and turning into an additional obstacle, making a phase-out of SAI more difficult by enhancing the carbon removal burden. The findings of this study may be contingent upon the configuration of the injection design and the representation of SAI within the model, as well as the underlying overshoot scenario. Further research is necessary to validate these results using different models incorporating diverse SAI deployment strategies and underlying emission trajectories. © 2025 Susanne Baur et al.","","Atmospheric aerosols; A-carbon; Carbon removal; Carbon uptake; Climate mitigations; Earth systems; Energy balance of the earth; Geoengineering; Mitigation strategy; Radiative energy balance; Stratospheric aerosols; aerosol; global warming; pollutant removal; simulation; Global warming","S.

A 40-member ensemble of CanESM5 retrospective decadal forecasts (or hindcasts) is integrated for 10 years from realistic initial states once a year during 1961 to the present using prescribed external forcing. The results are part of CCCma's contribution to the Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP) component of CMIP6. This paper evaluates CanESM5 large ensemble decadal hindcasts against observational benchmarks and against historical climate simulations initialized from pre-industrial control run states. The focus is on the evaluation of the potential predictability and actual skill of annual and multi-year averages of key oceanic and atmospheric fields at regional and global scales. The impact of initialization on prediction skill is quantified from the hindcasts decomposition into uninitialized and initialized components. The dependence of potential and actual skill on ensemble size is examined. CanESM5 decadal hindcasts skillfully predict upper-ocean states and surface climate with a significant impact from initialization that depend on climate variable, forecast range, and geographic location. Deficiencies in the skill of North Atlantic surface climate are identified and potential causes discussed. The inclusion of biogeochemical modules in CanESM5 enables the prediction of carbon cycle variables which are shown to be potentially skillful on decadal timescales, with a strong long-lasting impact from initialization on skill in the ocean and a moderate short-lived impact on land.  © 2021 Reinel Sospedra-Alfonso et al.","","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); carbon cycle; climate effect; climate prediction; numerical model","R.

This study integrates the Sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project climate models, sea-level rise projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios, and applies machine learning techniques to assess the risk of coral rubble instability in the Great Barrier Reef under future wave climate and depth change scenarios. Using the EC-Earth climate model under the SSP5-8.5 scenario—calibrated with data from 41 synoptic stations—we estimated various climate data for 2031–2100 and examined the impact of key factors such as wave climate and depth changes on the risk of coral instability. Coral rubble instability risk depends on future wave climate and depth changes from sea-level rise and deposition. Future changes in wave climate are expected to increase the risk of instability, while increased depth mitigates these destabilizing effects. Over the next 70 years, most areas of the Great Barrier Reef are projected to experience stable or decreasing risk of coral rubble instability. The proportion of no-risk areas is higher in the northern regions, whereas the far southern regions have fewer no-risk areas and more high-risk zones. High-risk and very high-risk areas are mainly concentrated along reef edges, reefs facing the Pacific Ocean, and shallow waters near the shoreline. The transition between high-risk and low-risk areas is gradual rather than abrupt. Annual projections align with long-term trends: coral rubble remains relatively stable in the northern and central regions, which is more conducive to future coral recovery. However, the persistent presence of high-risk and very high risk areas poses significant challenges to coral recovery in the far southern region. By providing insights into the spatial and temporal evolution of coral rubble instability risk, this study aims to support decision-makers, environmental scientists and researchers in formulating appropriate interventions to enhance the resilience of coral reefs under changing environmental conditions. © 2025 The Author(s)","Coral rubble instability risk mapping; Coupled model intercomparison project; IPCC sixth assessment report; Random forest; Spatial-temporal perspective","Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; Global warming; Reefs; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Sea level; Coral rubble; Coral rubble instability risk mapping; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Instability risks; IPCC sixth assessment report; Random forests; Risk mappings; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal perspective; Wave climates; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; machine learning; temporal evolution; wave climate; Article; climate change; climate model; coral reef; deposition rate; environmental risk; global climate; hydrodynamics; machine learning; Pacific Ocean; random forest; risk assessment; sea level rise; water depth; Risk assessment",""

Initialized climate model simulations have proven skillful for near-term predictability of the key physical climate variables, for example, temperature, precipitation, etc. By comparison, predictions of biogeochemical fields like ocean carbon flux, are still emerging. Initial studies indicate skillful predictions are possible for lead-times up to 6 years at global scale for some CMIP6 models. However, unlike core physical variables, biogeochemical variables are not directly initialized in existing decadal prediction systems, and extensive empirical parametrization of ocean-biogeochemistry in Earth System Models introduces a significant source of uncertainty. Here we propose a new approach for improving the skill of decadal ocean carbon flux predictions using observationally-constrained statistical models, as alternatives to the ocean-biogeochemistry models. We use observations to train multi-linear and neural-network models to predict the ocean carbon flux. To account for observational uncertainties, we train using six different observational estimates of the flux. We then apply these trained statistical models using input predictors from the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM5) decadal prediction system to produce new decadal predictions. Our hybrid GCM-statistical approach significantly improves prediction skill, relative to the raw CanESM5 hindcast predictions over 1990–2019. Our hybrid-model skill is also larger than that obtained by any available CMIP6 model. Using bias-corrected CanESM5 predictors, we make forecasts for ocean carbon flux over 2020–2029. Both statistical models predict increases in the ocean carbon flux larger than the changes predicted from CanESM5 forecasts. Our work highlights the ability to improve decadal ocean carbon flux predictions by using observationally-trained statistical models together with robust input predictors from GCM-based decadal predictions. © 2024 His Majesty the King in Right of Canada and Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ).

This mode acts as a pivotal conduit, connecting extratropical atmospheric shifts with the tropical El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), thereby carrying significant weight in enhancing the accuracy of ENSO forecasting. This study endeavors to evaluate the efficacy of the Community Integrated Earth System Model (CIESM) in replicating the NPMM and its influence on the evolution of ENSO. The results show that the CIESM can effectively simulate the air-sea coupling process of the NPMM and the NPMM-ENSO relationship, with the highest skill among 40 CMIP6 models. Furthermore, the CIESM successfully captures the thermodynamic and oceanic dynamical processes of the NPMM influences on the subsequent ENSO events, including the wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature feedback mechanism and the trade-wind charging mechanism. Additionally, it is found that the bias in the NPMM-ENSO relation across 40 CMIP6 models stems from the intensity of the WES feedback process, particularly the atmospheric response to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the subtropical North Pacific, which is modulated by the meridional position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Consequently, the findings of this study hold significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of climate model simulations and ENSO predictions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","CMIP6 model; ENSO; The North Pacific Meridional Mode; Wind-Evaporation-Sea surface temperature feedback","Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); CMIP; community composition; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; integrated approach; prediction; thermodynamics","S.

The aim of this study was to assess the climate change effects on temperature extreme indices (TEIs) in northeastern Iran based on the CMIP6 projections. For this purpose, five extreme indices including maximum of maximum temperature (TXx), minimum of minimum temperature (TNn), cold nights (TN10p), warm nights (TN90p), and summer days (SU25) which are effective on plant growth were evaluated. The projections of the three Earth system models including ACCESS-CM2, MIROC6, and MRI-ESM2-0 were assessed under the three scenarios of SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 for the period 2026–2050 compared to the historical period (1989–2014). The models’ projections were evaluated by statistical tests on the changes in the average and trend of data. Results showed that the MRI-ESM2-0 model revealed the best efficiency compared to the other models. The projections of all models and scenarios indicated a significant increase in the average of TXx and SU25 indices over the study area at the confidence level of 95% by 1.6 to 2.4 °C, as well as 15 to 18 days under the three scenarios. Also, the results exhibited a significant increasing trend in TN90p and a decreasing one in TN10p overall province at confidence level of 95%. These changes will lead to an increase in evapotranspiration of the plants and an increase in agricultural water demand, and as a result, a decrease in the yield of some main products like wheat and saffron which are the main products in the study area. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Climate change; CMIP6; ETCCDI; Khorasan Razavi; Statistical tests; Temperature extreme indices","Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Iran; Models, Theoretical; Seasons; Temperature; Iran; Atmospheric temperature; Hydrogeology; ozone; rain; Air temperature; CMIP6; Confidence levels; ETCCDI; Khorasan razavi; Maximum temperature; Plant growth; Study areas; Temperature extreme index; Temperature extremes; agricultural application; air temperature; climate change; climate prediction; CMIP; confidence interval; efficiency measurement; evapotranspiration; extreme event; future prospect; growth response; historical perspective; model test; temperature effect; temperature profile; water demand; water supply; weather forecasting; agriculture; air temperature; Article; astronomy; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; climate change; Crocus sativus; evapotranspiration; geographic distribution; Iran; irrigation (agriculture); nonhuman; plant development; plant growth; plant yield; simulation; sulfur cycle; temperature; wheat; climate change; environmental monitoring; procedures; season; theoretical model; Extreme weather","F.

Such modeling provides insights for engineers, and policymakers, thereby, aiding in informed decision-making for water resources utilization, agricultural production, as well as disaster preparedness. Furthermore, they support long-term climate adaptation strategies by assessing the impact of climate change on ecosystems, infrastructure, and water resources, facilitating evidence-based policy formulation for sustainable development and resilience building in Africa. There exist different climate models in the world, for example, CORDEX, GCM-CCSM4, HadGEM2-Es, RegCM4, WRF, CCLM, and CESM just to mention a few. The paper focused on climate models employed in Africa more so Kenya. Some of the identified models include, Climate Atlas Climate Model, Rossby Centre Regional Climate Model, CMIP5 Climate Model, CORDEX, and WRF. The CORDEX climate model is a regional climate model (RCM), and could be directly compared to CMIP6. Similarly, climate atlas model comprises of expert tools that are used in the evaluation of crop varieties, and a tailored solution provided. On the other hand, WRF uses a software architecture tool as well as a data assimilation system, which is then used in forecasting climate conditions. In summary, all these models help in temperature projections, precipitation patterns, sea-level rise estimates, and more, providing invaluable information for climate research, policy-making, and adaptation strategies in the complex Kenyan region. © 2024, Int.

Here we simulate the multi-century evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and its interaction with the climate using the Community Earth System Model version 2.2 (CESM2.2) including an interactive GrIS component (the Community Ice Sheet Model v2.1 [CISM2.1]) under an idealized warming scenario (atmospheric (Formula presented.) increases by 1% (Formula presented.) until quadrupling the pre-industrial level and then is held fixed). A variable-resolution (VR) grid with 1/ (Formula presented.) regional refinement over the broader Arctic and (Formula presented.) resolution elsewhere is applied to the atmosphere and land components, and the results are compared with conventional (Formula presented.) lat-lon grid simulations to investigate the impact of grid refinement. Compared with the (Formula presented.) runs, the VR run features a slower rate of surface melt, especially over the western and northern GrIS, where the ice surface slopes gently toward the periphery. This difference pattern originates primarily from higher snow albedo and, thus, weaker albedo feedback in the VR run. The VR grid better captures the CISM ice sheet topography by reducing elevation discrepancies between CAM and CISM and is, therefore, less reliant on the downscaling algorithm, which is known to underestimate albedo gradients. The sea level rise contribution from the GrIS in the VR run is 53 mm by year 150 and 831 mm by year 350, approximately 40% and 20% less than that of the (Formula presented.) runs, respectively. © 2025 The Author(s).

The standard CESM2.2 simulates a remarkable double-ITCZ bias in the central and eastern Pacific, especially in boreal winter and spring. Modifications to the closure in convection parameterization scheme greatly reduce the double-ITCZ bias in all seasons, demonstrating that convection parameterization can substantially influence the double-ITCZ bias in CESM2.2. Further analyses suggest that convection parameterization can modulate the tropical atmosphere-ocean feedback processes, through which it influences the SST in the southern ITCZ region and hence the double-ITCZ bias. The changes in the upper ocean temperature advection induced by modified convective closure plays important roles in reducing the warm SST bias and double-ITCZ precipitation bias in the southern ITCZ region. The modified convective closure improves the low-level cloud and shortwave cloud radiative forcing in the southeastern Pacific. However, surface heat flux plays only a limited role in reducing warm SST bias and double ITCZ bias because the impacts of shortwave radiation changes are largely canceled by changes in longwave radiation and latent heat flux. © 2025 The Author(s).

An AMOC weakening can have large climate impacts which influences the marine and terrestrial carbon cycle and hence atmospheric pCO2. However, the sign and mechanism of this response are subject to uncertainty. Here, we use a state-of-the-art Earth System Model, the Community Earth System Model v2 (CESM2), to study the atmospheric pCO2 response to an AMOC weakening under low (SSP1-2.6) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios over the years 2015–2100. A freshwater flux anomaly in the North Atlantic strongly weakens the AMOC, and we simulate a weak positive pCO2 response of 0.45 and 1.3 ppm increase per AMOC decrease in Sv for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. For SSP1-2.6 this response is driven by both the oceanic and terrestrial carbon cycles, whereas in SSP5-8.5 it is solely the ocean that drives the response. However, the spatial patterns of both the climate and carbon cycle response are similar in both emission scenarios over the course of the simulation period (2015–2100), showing that the response pattern is not dependent on cumulative CO2 emissions up to 2100. Though the global atmospheric pCO2 response might be small, locally large changes in both the carbon cycle and the climate system occur due to the AMOC weakening, which can have large detrimental effects on ecosystems and society. © The Author(s) 2024.","AMOC weakening; Atlantic meridional overturning circulation; Atmospheric pCO<sub>2</sub>; Carbon cycle; Climate change; Marine biosphere","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; circulation; climate change; current; greenhouse gas","A.A.

This work occurs at the intersection of glaciology and climate science and is motivated by a need for robust projections of sea-level rise. The Community Ice Sheet Model version 2 (CISM2) is the newest component model of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). This study describes the coupling and novel capabilities of the model, including: (1) an advanced energy-balance-based surface mass balance calculation in the land component with downscaling via elevation classes; (2) a closed freshwater budget from ice sheet to the ocean from surface runoff, basal melting, and ice discharge; (3) dynamic land surface types; and (4) dynamic atmospheric topography. The Earth system/ice-sheet coupling is demonstrated in a simulation with an evolving Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) under an idealized high CO2 scenario. The model simulates a large expansion of ablation areas (where surface ablation exceeds snow accumulation) and a large increase in surface runoff. This results in an elevated freshwater flux to the ocean, as well as thinning of the ice sheet and area retreat. These GrIS changes result in reduced Greenland surface albedo, changes in the sign and magnitude of sensible and latent heat fluxes, and modified surface roughness and overall ice sheet topography. Representation of these couplings between climate and ice sheets is key for the simulation of ice and climate interactions. © 2021. The Authors.

The radiation bias in MRI-CGCM3 that was used for CMIP5 simulations, particularly over the Southern Ocean, is significantly reduced in MRI-ESM2 that is used for CMIP6 simulations. Each modification that contributed to the reduction of the radiation bias was progressively reverted to the corresponding older treatment in order to examine their individual impacts on the ITCZ representation. Results show the double-ITCZ problem worsens almost monotonically when the excessive shortwave insolation over the Southern Ocean increases. The contribution of the atmosphere is about one third of the impact on the total northward energy transport and the corresponding response of the Hadley cell is related to the change in the double-ITCZ. However, our results also imply that the ITCZ bias cannot be completely resolved by the improvements of radiative flux alone and that there are other causes of the problem. © 2021 The Authors.

Comparison with an ensemble of previously conducted RACMO2 simulations forced by climate reanalysis demonstrates that the current product realistically represents the long-term average and variability of individual SMB components and captures the recent increase in meltwater runoff that accelerated GrIS mass loss. This means that, for the first time, climate forcing from an Earth system model (CESM2), which assimilates no observations, can be used without additional corrections to reconstruct the historical GrIS SMB and its recent decline that initiated mass loss in the 1990s. This paves the way for attribution studies of future GrIS mass loss projections and contribution to sea level rise. © Author(s) 2020.

Here, a coupled state-of-the-art Earth system model with an interactive carbon cycle (BNU-ESM) was used to investigate whether this proportionality extends to the complex Earth system model and to examine the climate system responses to different emission pathways with a common emission budget of man-made CO2. These new simulations show that, relative to the lower emissions earlier and higher emissions later (LH) scenario, the amount of carbon sequestration by the land and the ocean will be larger and Earth will experience earlier warming of climate under the higher emissions earlier and lower emissions later (HL) scenario. The processes within the atmosphere, land, and cryosphere, which are highly sensitive to climate, show a relatively linear relationship to cumulative CO2 emissions and will attain similar states under both scenarios, mainly because of the negative feedback between the radiative forcing and ocean heat uptake. However, the processes with larger internal inertias depend on both the CO2 emissions scenarios and the emission budget, such as ocean warming and sea level rise. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Anthropogenic effects; Applications; Carbon cycle; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Models and modeling; Numerical analysis/modeling; Physical meteorology and climatology","Applications; Atmospheric radiation; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Global warming; Sea level; Anthropogenic effects; Carbon cycles; Carbon sequestration; Cumulative emissions; Earth system model; Linear relationships; Numerical analysis/modeling; Surface air temperatures; anthropogenic effect; carbon cycle; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate modeling; numerical model; Climate models","W.

Based on the efforts of COP21 to limit global warming to 2.0&thinsp;°C or even 1.5&thinsp;°C by the end of the 21st century (Paris Agreement), we simulate the future contribution of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) to sea-level change under the low emission Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 scenario. The Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) with higher-order approximation is used and initialized with a hybrid approach of spin-up and data assimilation. For three general circulation models (GCMs: HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC5) the projections are conducted up to 2300 with forcing fields for surface mass balance (SMB) and ice surface temperature computed by the surface energy balance model of intermediate complexity (SEMIC). The projected sea-level rise ranges between 21-38&thinsp;mm by 2100 and 36-85&thinsp;mm by 2300. According to the three GCMs used, global warming will exceed 1.5&thinsp;°C early in the 21st century. The RCP2.6 peak and decline scenario is therefore manually adjusted in another set of experiments to suppress the 1.5&thinsp;°C overshooting effect. These scenarios show a sea-level contribution that is on average about 38&thinsp;% and 31&thinsp;% less by 2100 and 2300, respectively. For some experiments, the rate of mass loss in the 23rd century does not exclude a stable ice sheet in the future. This is due to a spatially integrated SMB that remains positive and reaches values similar to the present day in the latter half of the simulation period. Although the mean SMB is reduced in the warmer climate, a future steady-state ice sheet with lower surface elevation and hence volume might be possible. Our results indicate that uncertainties in the projections stem from the underlying GCM climate data used to calculate the surface mass balance. However, the RCP2.6 scenario will lead to significant changes in the GrIS, including elevation changes of up to 100&thinsp;m. The sea-level contribution estimated in this study may serve as a lower bound for the RCP2.6 scenario, as the currently observed sea-level rise is not reached in any of the experiments; this is attributed to processes (e.g. ocean forcing) not yet represented by the model, but proven to play a major role in GrIS mass loss. © 2018 Copernicus GmbH.

The anomalies between the experiments were collected in a system of two nested grids, with 1 / 3 ∘ and 1 / 12 ∘ horizontal resolutions.

In this configuration, the terrestrial biogeochemical model, which includes carbon-nitrogen dynamics and is present in earlier model versions, is coupled to an ocean biogeochemical model and atmospheric CO2 tracers. The authors provide a description of the model, detail how preindustrial-control and twentieth-century experiments were initialized and forced, and examine the behavior of the carbon cycle in those experiments. They examine how sea- and land-to-air CO2 fluxes contribute to the increase of atmospheric CO2 in the twentieth century, analyze how atmospheric CO2 and its surface fluxes vary on interannual time scales, including how they respond to ENSO, and describe the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 and its surface fluxes. While the model broadly reproduces observed aspects of the carbon cycle, there are several notable biases, including having too large of an increase in atmospheric CO2 over the twentieth century and too small of a seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 in the Northern Hemisphere. The biases are related to a weak response of the carbon cycle to climatic variations on interannual and seasonal time scales and to twentieth-century anthropogenic forcings, including rising CO2, land-use change, and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.","Carbon cycle; Climate models; Coupled models; Model evaluation/performance","Biogeochemistry; Climate models; Climatology; Land use; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen; Surface measurement; Atmospheric depositions; Biogeochemical modeling; Carbon cycles; Climatic variation; Coupled models; Interannual time scale; Model evaluation/performance; Northern Hemispheres; biogeochemical cycle; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; surface flux; twentieth century; Carbon dioxide",""

In a CMIP5 multimodel analysis, the annual cycles of temperature and precipitation simulated by HadGEM2-ES were very close to the multimodel ensemble mean. HadGEM2-ES temperature simulation compares well with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis over the 1979-2004 periods, except for a summer overestimation in Central Africa, and a winter underestimation in tropical West Africa. The precipitation simulation compared well with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) data from 1979 to 2004 over the entire Africa, except in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), where the model fails to capture adequately the transition phase of the monsoon circulation. The dry regimes over Northern Africa as well as the wetter regime occurring over Central Africa, which is mainly regulated by the ITCZ displacement, and during the austral summer of Southern Africa, are also fairly reproduced by the HadGEM2-ES model. The model projects for the end of the 21st century a rainy South Africa, a change of the flood/drought cycle in the Tropics and a warming over the whole continent, varying from 3 to 7°C. HadGEM2-ES performance for Nigeria shows good reproduction of precipitation seasonal cycles for some locations, outside the ITCZ. However, the comparison with in situ measurement in Ilorin and Lagos shows the model is not being able to reproduce the precipitation annual cycle. Future projections for Nigeria exhibit warming everywhere and an enhancement of precipitation, especially in the northern part of the country. © 2015 Royal Meteorological Society.","African climate; Future projections; Precipitation; RCPs; Temperature","Cell proliferation; Climate models; Climatology; Precipitation (chemical); Precipitation (meteorology); Temperature; Tropics; African climate; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Future projections; Global precipitation climatology projects; Intertropical convergence zone; National center for atmospheric researches; RCPs; Temperature simulations; Atmospheric temperature",""

For the present climate of Dec-Jan-Feb from 1963 to 2003 period these statistical models are developed and validated using the observed daily precipitation and simulated from the historical outputs of four models of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The simulations from all the models during DJF and FMA seasons have an anomalous intensification of the ITCZ and southward displacement in comparison with the climatology. Correlations of 0.54, 0.66, and 0.66 are found between the simulated daily precipitation of the CCSM4, GFDL_ESM2M, and MIROC_ESM models during DJF season and the observed values during FMA season. Only the CCSM4 model displays a slightly reasonable agreement with the observations. A comparison between the statistical downscaling using the nonlinear (ANN) and linear model (MLR) to identify the one most suitable for the analysis of daily precipitation was made. The ANN technique provides more ability to predict the present climate when compared to MLR technique. Based on this result, we examined the accuracy of the ANN model in project the changes for the future climate period from 2055 to 2095 over the same study region. For instance, a comparison between the daily precipitations changes projected indirectly from the ANN during Feb-Mar-Apr with those projected directly from the CMIP5 models forced by RCP 8.5 scenario is made. The results suggest that ANN model weights the CMIP5 projections according to the each model ability in simulating the present climate (and its variability). In others, the ANN model is a potentially promising approach to use as a complementary tool to improvement of the seasonal numerical simulations. © 2015 da Silva and Mendes.","Artificial neural network; CMIP5 models; Intertropical convergence zone; Multiple linear regression; Precipitation; Sea surface temperature","","G.A.M. da Silva; Department of Sea Sciences, University Federal of São Paulo, Ponta da Praia, Santos/SP, Av., Alm.

We aimed to explore possible responses of northern peatlands to future climate change and to quantify the role of northern peatlands in the carbon balance of the Northern Hemisphere. Location: The terrestrial Northern Hemisphere (>30° N). Time period: 1861–2099. Major taxa studied: Not a specific plant species, but a plant functional type is used by the model to represent an average of all vegetation growing in northern peatlands. Methods: The ORCHIDEE-PEAT v.2.0 process-based land surface model was used to simulate area and carbon dynamics of northern peatlands. The model was driven up to the year 2099 by the global CO2 concentration from representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5 by corresponding climate projections from two general circulation models after bias correction. Results: First, from 1861 to 2005 the mean annual carbon balance of northern peatlands was an atmospheric CO2 sink of 0.10 PgC/year, and this sink will roughly double in the future under both RCP2.6 and RCP6.0, whereas the total northern peatlands will be either a source of CO2 (IPSL-CM5A-LR) or near neutral (GFDL-ESM2M) by the end of the century under RCP8.5. Second, the peatlands in western Canada, western and northern Europe may experience reducing areas and may shift from being CO2 sinks to sources, especially under rapid climate warming. Third, peatland enhances soil carbon accumulation in the Northern Hemisphere (lands north of 30° N). Main conclusions: In this study, future changes in both northern peatland extent and peatland carbon storage are simulated. We highlight that undisturbed northern peatlands are small but persistent carbon sinks in the future; thus, it is important to protect these ecosystems. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","21st century; climate change; CO<sub>2</sub> flux; land surface model; northern peatlands; peatland extent; permafrost","Canada; Northern Europe; Western Europe; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sink; climate change; ecosystem modeling; land surface; Northern Hemisphere; peatland; permafrost; twenty first century","C.

In this paper, we introduce model developments included in CLM version 5 (CLM5), which is the default land component for CESM2. We assess an ensemble of simulations, including prescribed and prognostic vegetation state, multiple forcing data sets, and CLM4, CLM4.5, and CLM5, against a range of metrics including from the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMBv2) package. CLM5 includes new and updated processes and parameterizations: (1) dynamic land units, (2) updated parameterizations and structure for hydrology and snow (spatially explicit soil depth, dry surface layer, revised groundwater scheme, revised canopy interception and canopy snow processes, updated fresh snow density, simple firn model, and Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport), (3) plant hydraulics and hydraulic redistribution, (4) revised nitrogen cycling (flexible leaf stoichiometry, leaf N optimization for photosynthesis, and carbon costs for plant nitrogen uptake), (5) global crop model with six crop types and time-evolving irrigated areas and fertilization rates, (6) updated urban building energy, (7) carbon isotopes, and (8) updated stomatal physiology. New optional features include demographically structured dynamic vegetation model (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator), ozone damage to plants, and fire trace gas emissions coupling to the atmosphere. Conclusive establishment of improvement or degradation of individual variables or metrics is challenged by forcing uncertainty, parametric uncertainty, and model structural complexity, but the multivariate metrics presented here suggest a general broad improvement from CLM4 to CLM5. ©2019.

The historical run is forced by the air-sea fluxes calculated from Coordinated Ocean Reference Experiment version 2 (COREv2) data. Three future runs—ROMS-MIROC, ROMS-CSIRO, and ROMS-GFDL—are forced with an atmospheric field constructed by adding the difference between the climate model parameters for the twenty-first and twentieth century to fields in the historical run. In all downscaling, the RSL rise along the eastern coast of Japan is generally half or less of the RSL rise maxima off the eastern coast. The projected regional (total) sea level rises along the Honshu coast during 2081–2100 relative to 1981–2000 are 19–25 (98–104), 6–15 (71–80), and 8–14 (80–86) cm in ROMS-MIROC, ROMS-CSIRO, and ROMS-GFDL, respectively. The discrepancies of the RSL rise along the Honshu coast between the climate models and downscaling are less than 10 cm. The RSL changes in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) region in all downscaling simulations are related to the changes of KE (northward shift or intensification) with climate change. © 2016, The Oceanographic Society of Japan and Springer Japan.","","Honshu; Japan; Kuroshio Current; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); climate change; climate modeling; coastal zone; downscaling; eddy; sea level change","Z.-J.

HadGEM2-ES comprises atmosphere, ocean and sea-ice components which are interactively coupled to representations of the carbon cycle, aerosols including mineral dust and tropospheric chemistry. In this study, we focus on the atmosphere-only model HadGEM2-A coupled to terrestrial carbon cycle and aerosol models. This configuration is forced with monthly sea surface temperature and sea-ice fields from equivalent coupled simulations with an older version of the Hadley Centre model, HadCM3. HadGEM2-A simulates extreme cooling over northern continents and nearly complete die back of vegetation in Asia, giving a poor representation of the LGM environment compared with reconstructions of surface temperatures and biome distributions. The model also performs significantly worse for the LGM in comparison with its precursor AR4 model HadCM3M2. Detailed analysis shows that the major factor behind the vegetation die off in HadGEM2-A is a subtle change to the temperature dependence of leaf mortality within the phenology model of HadGEM2. This impacts on both snow-vegetation albedo and vegetation dynamics. A new set of parameters is tested for both the pre-industrial and LGM, showing much improved coverage of vegetation in both time periods, including an improved representation of the needle-leaf forest coverage in Siberia for the pre-industrial. The new parameters and the resulting changes in global vegetation distribution strongly impact the simulated loading of mineral dust, an important aerosol for the LGM. The climate response in an abrupt 4× pre-industrial CO2 simulation is also analysed and shows modest regional impacts on surface temperatures across the Boreal zone. © 2014, The Author(s).","Land surface feedbacks; LGM; Palaeoclimate sensitivity","Siberia; aerosol; boundary condition; carbon cycle; Last Glacial Maximum; paleoclimate; sea ice; sea surface temperature; temperature effect",""

Global warming in the model by the end of the 21st century is 1.9 K for the RCP4.5 scenario and 3.4 K for RCP8.5. The spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation changes driven by the enhanced greenhouse effect is similar to that derived from the INMCM3 model data. In the INMCM4 model, however, the heat flux to the ocean and sea-level rise caused by thermal expansion are roughly 1.5 times as large as those in the INMCM3 model under the same scenario. A decrease in sea-ice extent and a change in heat fluxes and meridional circulation in the ocean under global warming, as well as some aspects of natural climate variability in the model, are considered. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","atmosphere; carbon cycle; climate changes; cryosphere; global warming; greenhouse gases; IPCC; ocean","atmosphere-ocean system; carbon cycle; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; cryosphere; global warming; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; nineteenth century; numerical model; spatial distribution; twenty first century","E.

The approach is based upon PDFs for the equilibrium response to doubled carbon dioxide, derived from a comprehensive sampling of uncertainties in modelling of surface and atmospheric processes, and constrained by multiannual mean observations of recent climate. These PDFs are sampled and scaled by global mean temperature predicted by a Simple Climate Model (SCM), in order to emulate corresponding transient responses. The sampled projections are then reweighted, based upon the likelihood that they correctly replicate observed historical changes in surface temperature, and combined to provide PDFs for 20 year averages of regional temperature and precipitation changes to the end of the twenty-first century, for the A1B emissions scenario. The PDFs also account for modelling uncertainties associated with aerosol forcing, ocean heat uptake and the terrestrial carbon cycle, sampled using SCM configurations calibrated to the response of perturbed physics ensembles generated using the Hadley Centre climate model HadCM3, and other international climate model simulations. Weighting the projections using observational metrics of recent mean climate is found to be as effective at constraining the future transient response as metrics based on historical trends. The spread in global temperature response due to modelling uncertainty in the carbon cycle feedbacks is determined to be about 65-80 % of the spread arising from uncertainties in modelling atmospheric, oceanic and aerosol processes of the climate system. Early twenty-first century aerosol forcing is found to be extremely unlikely to be less than -1.7 W m-2. Our technique provides a rigorous and formal method of combining several lines of evidence used in the previous IPCC expert assessment of the Transient Climate Response. The 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles of our observationally constrained PDF for the Transient Climate Response are 1.6, 2.0 and 2.4 °C respectively, compared with the 10-90 % range of 1.0-3.0 °C assessed by the IPCC. © 2013 Crown Copyright.","Aerosol forcing; Bayesian; Carbon cycle uncertainty; Observational constraints; Perturbed physics ensembles; Probabilistic climate projections; Transient climate response; Uncertainty","aerosol; Bayesian analysis; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; multivariate analysis; observational method; probability; regional climate; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis","G.

This article describes the different model components, their coupling, and the simulated climate in comparison to previous model versions. We focus here on the representation of the physical climate along with the main characteristics of the global carbon cycle. The model's climatology, as assessed from a range of metrics (related in particular to radiation, temperature, precipitation, and wind), is strongly improved in comparison to previous model versions. Although they are reduced, a number of known biases and shortcomings (e.g., double Intertropical Convergence Zone [ITCZ], frequency of midlatitude wintertime blockings, and El Niño–Southern Oscillation [ENSO] dynamics) persist. The equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response have both increased from the previous climate model IPSL-CM5A-LR used in CMIP5. A large ensemble of more than 30 members for the historical period (1850–2018) and a smaller ensemble for a range of emissions scenarios (until 2100 and 2300) are also presented and discussed. ©2020.

The objective of this work is to simulate potential changes in the rainforest biome in Central America subject to anthropogenic climate change under two emissions scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The use of a dynamic vegetation model and climate change scenarios is an approach to investigate, assess or anticipate how biomes respond to climate change. In this work, the Inland dynamic vegetation model was driven by the Eta regional climate model simulations. These simulations accept boundary conditions from HadGEM2-ES runs in the two emissions scenarios. The possible consequences of regional climate change on vegetation properties, such as biomass, net primary production and changes in forest extent and distribution, were investigated. The Inland model projections show reductions in tropical forest cover in both scenarios. The reduction of tropical forest cover is greater in RCP8.5. The Inland model projects biomass increases where tropical forest remains due to the CO2 fertilization effect. The future distribution of predominant vegetation shows that some areas of tropical rainforest in Central America are replaced by savannah and grassland in RCP4.5. Inland projections under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 show a net primary productivity reduction trend due to significant tropical forest reduction, temperature increase, precipitation reduction and dry spell increments, despite the biomass increases in some areas of Costa Rica and Panama. This study may provide guidance to adaptation studies of climate change impacts on the tropical rainforests in Central America. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","","Central America; Costa Rica; Panama [Central America]; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Ecosystems; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Tropics; Vegetation; Anthropogenic climate changes; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Dynamic vegetation model; Net primary production; Net primary productivity; Regional climate changes; Regional climate model simulation; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate modeling; ecosystem modeling; forest cover; forest ecosystem; net primary production; rainforest; savanna; tropical forest; vegetation dynamics; Climate change","A.

This model has been developed as an extension of the atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model, MRI-CGCM3, by adding chemical and biogeochemical processes. The dynamic and thermodynamic processes are entirely the same in both models. The horizontal resolution of MRI-ESM1 is higher than that of the ozone model that handles chemical processes which require high computational cost. In the control experiment, it is confirmed that the climatic drift of the model is insignificant with regard to surface air temperature (SAT), the radiation budget, and trace gas (carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone) concentrations. Compared with a control experiment by MRI-CGCM3, SAT is slightly higher because of a higher tropospheric ozone concentration. The performance of MRI-ESM1 is validated by conducting a historical experiment. Overall, MRI-ESM1 simulates well observed historical changes in SAT and trace gas concentrations. However, increases in the SAT and atmospheric CO2 concentration are underestimated, associated with a positive feedback process through soil respiration. Namely the underestimation of atmospheric CO2 increase causes weak SAT rise which makes soil respiration inactive, and then the excess of net land surface CO2 uptake suppresses increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The simulated present-day climate states of SAT, radiation fluxes, precipitation, and trace gas concentrations are also in good agreement with observations although there are errors of radiations, precipitation, and ozone concentration especially over the southern tropical Pacific in the simulation. These errors appear to be originated from the excess of convective activity: so-called double ITCZ (intertropical convergence zone). Both MRIESM1 and MRI-CGCM3 are similarly able to reproduce the present-day climatology. In future projections, the global mean SAT rise at the end of the 21st century relative to the pre-industrial era is 3.4°C in the experiment using the Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) by MRI-ESM1, whereas it is 4.0°C in the MRI-CGCM3 experiment. The atmospheric CO2 concentration projected by MRI-ESM1 for the end of the 21st century is about 800 ppm, which is lower by 130 ppm than that prescribed in the RCP8.5 experiment with MRI-CGCM3. This difference is consistent with the above-mentioned difference in the SAT rise between MRI-ESM1 and MRI-CGCM3.

Simulations with standard parametrization (run 1) and improved parametrization of vertical mixing (run 2) were compared. Run 1 showed shallower mixed layer depths (MLDs) in spring as compared to observations owing to lower salinities in the upper 200 m of the subpolar North Atlantic (>55º N). This coincided with a mismatch with observed timing and magnitude of the phytoplankton spring bloom. In contrast, the model performed well south of 55º N. Run 2 showed improved springtime MLD, phytoplankton dynamics, and nutrient distributions in the subpolar North Atlantic. Our study underlines the sensitivity of subpolar North Atlantic phytoplankton blooms to surface freshening, suggesting that future fresh-water inflow from Arctic and Greenland Ice sheet melting could significantly affect phytoplankton productivity.

For three of the four RCPs, the analysis is extended to 2300. The compatible emissions compare well with those generated by integrated assessment models from which the RCPs were constructed. Historical compatible emissions are also presented, which closely match observation-based estimates from 1860 to 2005 (cumulatively 330 and 319 GtC, respectively). Simulated land and ocean carbon uptake, which determines the compatible emissions, is examined, with an emphasis on changes in vegetation carbon. In addition, historical land and ocean carbon uptake is compared with observations. The influences of climate change and the carbon cycle on compatible emissions are investigated individually through two additional experiments in which either aspect is decoupled from the CO2 pathway. Exposure of the biogeochemical components of the Earth system to increasingCO2 is found to be responsible for 68% of the compatible emissions of the fully coupled simulation, while increased radiative forcing from the CO2 pathway reduces its compatible emissions by 11%. The importance of dynamic vegetation to compatible emissions is investigated and discussed. Two different methods of determining emissions from land use and land-use change are compared; differencing the land-atmosphere CO2 exchange of two experiments, one with fixed land use and the other variable, results in historical land-use emissions within the uncertainty range of observed estimates, while those simulated directly by the model are well below the lower limit of the observations.","","Atmospheric radiation; Carbon; Climate change; Computer simulation; Experiments; Forestry; Land use; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Additional experiments; Biogeochemical; Carbon uptake; Environmental model; Fully-coupled; Integrated assessment models; Land-use change; Radiative forcings; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; computer simulation; emission control; environmental assessment; environmental modeling; land use change; radiative forcing; Carbon dioxide","S.

Assuming no associated response of ice dynamics, this will be a negative contribution to sea-level rise. However, the assessment of these changes using dynamical downscaling of coupled climate model projections still bears considerable uncertainties due to poorly represented high-southern-latitude atmospheric circulation and sea surface conditions (SSCs), that is sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration. This study evaluates the Antarctic surface climate simulated using a global high-resolution atmospheric model and assesses the effects on the simulated Antarctic surface climate of two different SSC data sets obtained from two coupled climate model projections. The two coupled models from which SSCs are taken, MIROC-ESM and NorESM1-M, simulate future Antarctic sea ice trends at the opposite ends of the CMIP5 RCP8.5 projection range. The atmospheric model ARPEGE is used with a stretched grid configuration in order to achieve an average horizontal resolution of 35 km over Antarctica. Over the 1981-2010 period, ARPEGE is driven by the SSCs from MIROC-ESM, NorESM1-M and CMIP5 historical runs and by observed SSCs. These three simulations are evaluated against the ERA-Interim reanalyses for atmospheric general circulation as well as the MAR regional climate model and in situ observations for surface climate. For the late 21st century, SSCs from the same coupled climate models forced by the RCP8.5 emission scenario are used both directly and bias-corrected with an anomaly method which consists in adding the future climate anomaly from coupled model projections to the observed SSCs with taking into account the quantile distribution of these anomalies. We evaluate the effects of driving the atmospheric model by the bias-corrected instead of the original SSCs. For the simulation using SSCs from NorESM1-M, no significantly different climate change signals over Antarctica as a whole are found when bias-corrected SSCs are used. For the simulation driven by MIROC-ESM SSCs, a significant additional increase in precipitation and in winter temperatures for the Antarctic Ice Sheet is obtained when using bias-corrected SSCs. For the range of Antarctic warming found (C 3 to C4 K), we confirm that snowfall increase will largely outweigh increases in melt and rainfall. Using the end members of sea ice trends from the CMIP5 RCP8.5 projections, the difference in warming obtained (~ 1 K) is much smaller than the spread of the CMIP5 Antarctic warming projections. This confirms that the errors in representing the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation in climate models are also determinant for the diversity of their projected late 21st century Antarctic climate change. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

The present study projects the variations of climatic variables such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Salinity (SSS), Sea Level Rise (SLR), Precipitation (Pr), and pH along the Indian Ocean. Climate projections for 2030, 2050 and 2080 were obtained as MIROC-ESM-CHEM, CMIP5 model output for each Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios. Each climatic variable was assessed for any change against the reference year of 2015. The RCP scenarios showed an increasing trend for SLR and SST while a decreasing trend for SSS and pH. The study focuses on assessing the impacts of projected variations on marine and aquaculture system. The climate model projections show that the SST during 2080 is likely to rise by 0.69°C for the lowest emissions scenario and 2.6°C for the highest emissions scenario. Elevated temperature disturbs the homeostasis of fish and subjects to physiological stress in the habitat resulting in mortality. These thermal limits can predict distributional changes of marine species in response to climate change. Projections showed no significant changes in the pattern of precipitation. Changes in sea level rise and sea surface salinity reduce water quality, spawning and seed availability, increased disease incidence and damage to freshwater aquaculture system by salinization of groundwater. The results show that variation in SST and pH have a potential impact on marine fisheries while SSS, SLR, Precipitation affects the aquaculture systems. The synergic effects of climatic variations are found to have negative implications on capture fisheries as well as aquaculture system and are elucidated through this work. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.","Adaptive strategies; Aquaculture; Climate change; Fisheries; RCP; Temperature","Indian Ocean; aquaculture industry; aquaculture system; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; disease incidence; fishery; homeostasis; precipitation (climatology); sea level change; sea surface salinity; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature effect","P.U.

Climate models, such as those participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), are used to assess this uncertainty. The Community Earth System Model version 2.1 (CESM2) is a CMIP6 model capable of running climate simulations with either one-way coupling (fixed ice sheet geometry) or two-way coupling (dynamic geometry) to the GrIS. The model features prognostic snow albedo, online downscaling using elevation classes, and a firn pack to refreeze percolating melt water. Here we evaluate the representation of the GrIS surface energy balance and surface mass balance in CESM2 at 1° resolution with fixed GrIS geometry. CESM2 agrees closely with ERA-Interim reanalysis data for key controls on GrIS SMB: surface pressure, sea ice extent, 500 hPa geopotential height, wind speed, and 700 hPa air temperature. Cloudsat-CALIPSO data show that supercooled liquid-containing clouds are adequately represented, whereas comparisons to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and CM SAF Cloud, Albedo, and Surface Radiation data set from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data second edition data suggest that CESM2 underestimates surface albedo. The seasonal cycle and spatial patterns of surface energy balance and surface mass balance components in CESM2 agree well with regional climate model RACMO2.3p2, with GrIS-integrated melt, refreezing, and runoff bracketed by RACMO2 counterparts at 11 and 1 km. Time series of melt, runoff, and SMB show a break point around 1990, similar to RACMO2. These results suggest that GrIS SMB is realistic in CESM2, which adds confidence to coupled ice sheet-climate experiments that aim to assess the GrIS contribution to future sea level rise. ©2020.

The cold climate was responsible for crop failures, leading to serious famine and high food prices in Europe and North America. The year 1816 became known as the ""year without summer"". We performed a series of climate simulations with the UK Met Office model HadGEM2-ES to assess the climate and carbon cycle consequences of the eruption. The model shows a temperature decrease of 1 ± 0.1°C and global precipitation decrease of 3.7% in 1816. The following net primary productivity (NPP) increase is caused by strongly reduced plant respiration and supports the overall increase in land carbon storage after the eruption. Most of the carbon is taken up by the soil reservoir, mainly due to increased litter influx. Overall, the change of combined land and ocean carbon implies an atmospheric CO2 decrease of over 6 ppmv. C3 and C4 grasses, used here as an analogy for crops, revealed globally increasing productivity for C3 grasses/crops (e.g., wheat) by ≥8%, while C4 grasses/crops (e.g., maize) decreased by over 12%. Regional positive C3 and negative C4 NPP are mainly found in the tropics and midlatitudes, whereas positive C4 NPP areas are distributed in marginal areas. Negative C3 grasses anomalies are found in high-elevation and high-latitude regions. These findings highlight the importance of including process-based vegetation or crop model components to represent the potentially nonlinear dependencies on climatic changes.

In turn, climate change due to aerosols has impacted the C cycle. Here we use a set of offline simulations made with the Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) land surface model driven by bias-corrected climate fields from simulations of three Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Earth system models (ESMs; IPSL-CM5A-LR, CSIRO-Mk3.6.0, and GISS-E2-R) to quantify the climate-related impacts of aerosols on land carbon fluxes during 1860–2005. We found that climate change from anthropogenic aerosols (CCAA) globally cooled the climate, and increased land carbon storage, or cumulative net biome production (NBP), by 11.6–41.8 PgC between 1860 and 2005. The increase in NBP from CCAA mainly occurs in the tropics and northern midlatitudes, primarily due to aerosol-induced cooling. At high latitudes, cooling caused stronger decrease in gross primary production (GPP) than in total ecosystem respiration (TER), leading to lower NBP. At midlatitudes, cooling-induced decrease in TER is stronger than that of GPP, resulting in NBP increase. At low latitudes, NBP was also enhanced due to the cooling-induced GPP increase, but precipitation decline from CCAA may negate the effect of temperature. The three ESMs show large divergence in low-latitude CCAA precipitation response to aerosols, which results in considerable uncertainties in regional estimations of CCAA effects on carbon fluxes. Our results suggest that better understanding and simulation of how anthropogenic aerosols affect precipitation in ESMs is required for a more accurate attribution of aerosol effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. © 2019.

Comparisons to SAG simulations based on a high emission pathway baseline scenario (SSP5-85) are also performed to investigate the dependency of impacts using different injection amounts to offset surface warming by SAG.

Furthermore, land net primary productivity as well as ocean acidification depend mostly on the global atmospheric <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> concentration and therefore the baseline scenario.

In CAM5 standalone, the northern ITCZ is associated with inertial instability and the southern ITCZ is thermally forced. After air-sea coupling, the processes on both hemispheres are switched because the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) is changed. Biases occur during boreal spring in both CAM5 and the ocean model. In CAM5 alone, weaker-than-observed equatorial easterly in the tropical eastern South Pacific leads to weaker evaporation and an increase in local SST. The shallow meridional circulation overly converges in the same region in the CAM5 standalone simulation, the planetary boundary layer and middle troposphere are too humid, and the large-scale subsidence is too weak at the middle levels. These biases may result from excessive shallow convection behavior in CAM5. The extra moisture would then fuel stronger convection and a higher precipitation rate in the southeastern Pacific. In the ocean model, the South Equatorial Current is underestimated and the North Equatorial Countercurrent is located too close to the equator, causing a warm SST bias in the southeastern Pacific and a cold bias in the northeastern Pacific. These SST biases feed back to the atmosphere and further influence convection and the surface wind biases in the coupled simulation. When the convection in the tropical northeastern Pacific becomes thermally forced after coupling, the northern ITCZ is diminished due to colder SST, forming the so-called alternating ITCZ bias. © 2015 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Model evaluation/performance","Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layers; Earth atmosphere; Surface waters; Atmosphere-ocean interactions; Community atmosphere model; Intertropical convergence zone; Model evaluation/performance; North equatorial countercurrent; Planetary boundary layers; Sea surface temperature (SST); South equatorial currents; air-sea interaction; atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric modeling; boundary layer; intertropical convergence zone; meridional circulation; planetary atmosphere; sea surface temperature; troposphere; Oceanography",""

The annual mean GrIS mass loss in the last two decades is 2.7-mm sea level equivalent (SLE) year−1. The increased SLR contribution from the surface mass balance (3.1 mm SLE year−1) is partly offset by reduced ice discharge from thinning and retreat of outlet glaciers.

The iterative procedure of quantifying the potential sustainability of forest biogeocoenoses (ecoelements, or landtype phases) as the integral elementary chorological units of the biosphere has been stated. Statistically significant equations have been obtained for the relations between the stability indices of forest biogeocoenoses and their metabolic parameters and environmental factors. The large-scale matrix maps of resistance and resilience stability of forest communities are presented by the examples of the Zhiguli low-mountain range (National Park ""Samarskaya Luka"") and By-Oka-Terrace Biosphere Reserve. These maps characterize sensitivity of the given ecoregions to climatic changes and the subsequent succession/restoration potential, respectively.

In this study, we develop a simple earth system model called Beijing Climate Center Simple Earth System Model (BCC_SESM), which is based on the complex BCC_CSM1.1 model and its CMIP5 simulation results as inputs. The basic and complete processes are considered in the BCC_SESM initiating from the carbon emission, including the carbon cycle processes in atmosphere–land–ocean, the radiation forcing and temperature changes. The emission-driven simulation results for historical and RCP8.5 scenarios are selected as the default datasets, and econometric regressions are applied to calibrate the parameters. Projection analysis and sensitive experiments with the BCC_SESM show that this model is parsimonious and robust enough to reproduce results of original complex climate system model. We also compare results of parameters and projection efficacy of different mid-lower emission scenarios simulations by applying this BCC_SESM.

Using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, the first principal component of air-sea CO2 flux shows a significant relationship with the Niño-3.4 index in both the observation-based product and models. In the observation-based product, the spatial pattern of EOF1 shows negative anomalies in the central Pacific, which is, however, in contrast to those in several ESMs, and even opposite in sign to those in HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-LR. The unrealistic response of the air-sea CO2 flux to ENSO mainly originates from the biases in the anomalous surface-water CO2 partial pressure (pCO2sea ). A linear Taylor expansion by decomposing the anomalous pCO2sea into contributions from salinity, sea surface temperature, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and alkalinity is applied to diagnose the pCO2sea biases. The results show that decreased pCO2sea during El Niño results from reduced upwelling of high-concentration DIC from deeper layers that overwhelms the increasing pCO2sea caused by warmer sea surface temperature. Overly weak reduction of vertical motion during El Niño and weak vertical gradients of climatological DIC concentration are the main reasons for biases in the negative surface DIC anomalies and eventually the pCO2sea anomalies. This study highlights the importance of both physical ocean responses to El Niño and climatological distributions of carbon-related tracers in the simulation of the interannualvariability of air-sea CO2 fluxes. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","","Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical); Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Oceanography; Orthogonal functions; Principal component analysis; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Tropics; Climatological distributions; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Empirical orthogonal function analysis; First principal components; Interannual variability; Sea surface temperature (SST); Tropical Pacific ocean; air-sea interaction; annual variation; carbon flux; climate modeling; dissolved inorganic carbon; El Nino; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; empirical orthogonal function analysis; Nickel compounds","T.

The results have been examined by focusing on the approximate linear relationship between the temperature increase and cumulative CO2 emissions. Although the temperature increase is nearly proportional to the cumulative CO2 emissions in both models, this relationship does not necessarily provide a robust basis for the restriction of CO2 emissions because it is substantially modulated by non-CO2 forcing. CO2-induced warming, estimated from the atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the models, indicates an approximate compensation of nonlinear changes between fast-mode responses to concentration changes at less than 10 years and slow-mode response at more than 100 years due to the thermal inertia of the ocean. In this estimate, CESM1(BGC) closely approximates a linear trend of 1.7 °C per 1000 PgC, whereas MIROC-ESM shows a deviation toward higher temperatures after the emissions peak, from 1.8 °C to 2.4 °C per 1000 PgC over the range of 400-850 PgC cumulative emissions corresponding to years 2000-2050. The evolution of temperature under zero emissions, 2160-2300, shows a slight decrease of about 0.1 °C per century in CESM1(BGC), but remains almost constant in MIROC-ESM. The fast-mode response toward the equilibrium state decreases with a decrease in the airborne fraction owing to continued CO2 uptake (carbon cycle inertia), whereas the slow-mode response results in more warming owing to continued heat uptake (thermal inertia). Several specific differences are noted between the two models regarding the degree of this compensation and in some key regional aspects associated with sustained warming and long-term climate risks. Overall, elevated temperatures continue for at least a few hundred years under zero emissions. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon cycle; climate stabilization; cumulative emissions; Earth system model; zero emissions","Climate models; Earth (planet); Emission control; Stabilization; Carbon cycles; Climate stabilization; Cumulative emissions; Earth system model; Zero emission; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; environmental research; experimental study; long-term change; stabilization; temperature; warming; Carbon dioxide",""

Two different GCMs (ECHAM5 until 2100 and HadCM3 until 2200) and two different emission scenarios (A1B and E1) are used as forcing to capture a realistic range in future climate states. Simulated ice sheet averaged 2 m air temperature (T2m) increases (1.8-3.0 K in 2100 and 2.4-5.3 K in 2200), simultaneously and with the same magnitude as GCM simulated T2m. The SMB and its components increase in magnitude, as they are directly influenced by the temperature increase. Changes in atmospheric circulation around Antarctica play a minor role in future SMB changes. During the next two centuries, the projected increase in liquid water flux from rainfall and snowmelt, together 60-200 Gt year-1, will mostly refreeze in the snow pack, so runoff remains small (10-40 Gt year-1). Sublimation increases by 25-50 %, but remains an order of magnitude smaller than snowfall. The increase in snowfall mainly determines future changes in SMB on the AIS: 6-16 % in 2100 and 8-25 % in 2200. Without any ice dynamical response, this would result in an eustatic sea level drop of 20-43 mm in 2100 and 73-163 mm in 2200, compared to the twentieth century.

Examination of intermediate model versions created as part of the development process for CESM2 shows the improvement in the ITCZ is well correlated with a reduction in the relative warmth of southeast Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as compared to the broader tropical mean. Cooling SST in this region enhances the zonal SST and surface pressure gradients and reduces the anomalously southward SST gradient present in boreal spring in early version of CESM2. The improvements in southeast Pacific SST are attributed to increases in low cloud cover and the associated shortwave cloud forcing over the southeast. Sensitivity tests using fixed SST simulations demonstrate the increase in cloud cover between two intermediate model versions, 119 and 125, to be driven by removal of the dependence of autoconversion and accretion rates on cloud water variance as well as the removal of a secondary condensation scheme. Both of these changes reduce drizzle rates in warm clouds increasing cloud lifetime and cloud fraction in the stratocumulus to trade cumulus transition region. The improvements in southeast Pacific shortwave cloud forcing and ITCZ climatology persist through subsequent changes to the cloud microphysics parameterizations. Despite improvements in the east Pacific ITCZ, the global mean ITCZ position and Pacific cold tongue bias strength do not exhibit a systematic improvement across the development simulations. ©2019.

The investigation of future climate impacts at the coast thus requires sufficiently detailed projections for the offshore waves and sea levels in both the present day and under future climate scenarios, to provide boundary conditions for detailed coastal impact models. The process of model downscaling, in a climate modelling sense, is generally taken to refer to the generation of locally relevant data from the output of global circulation models of the atmosphere and ocean. The aim is to connect global-scale projections and regional dynamics to generate regionally specific projections relevant to coastal management decision-making. We discuss research conducted as part of Phase 2 of the Tyndall Coastal Simulator research project on the future changes in surge and wave climate forced by winds and sea-level atmospheric pressures from a version of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Model (HadCM3), assuming various greenhouse gas emission scenarios and for various climate model parameter choices. The local spatial variation in mean sea level is also taken into account, incorporating deviations from global mean sea-level caused by regional variations in ocean density and circulation. The UK is still subject to glacial isostatic adjustment after the last ice age, counteracting recent sea-level rise. Dynamical downscaling from a global coupled atmosphere- ocean model, using a regional climate model, has been used to provide more realistic and detailed simulations of wind and pressure over the NW European continental shelf. These were then used to drive storm surge and wave models. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.

The results show that the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations enhance the carbon fluxes, with increases of 117. 1 gC m-2 a-1 for net primary production (NPP), 98. 4 gC m-2 a-1 for soil respiration (Rh), and 18. 7 gC m-2 a-1 for net ecosystem production (NEP). Increased linear trends of NPP and Rh of about 0. 30 and 0. 25 PgC/ a2, respectively, occur across the whole terrestrial ecosystem, whereas for climate change impact, NPP has a reduced trend of-19. 3 gC m-2 a-1. The soil respiration reduces by-8. 5 gC m-2 and NEP varies by about-10. 8 gC m-2. For the whole terrestrial ecosystem, linear decreased trends of NPP and Rh are approximately-0. 07 PgC/a2 and-0. 04 PgC/a2(P<0. 05). Regions show large differences of NPP distribution in response to climate change. Low latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere exhibit decreased NPP, while NPP is somewhat increased in the mid and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Enhanced vegetation growth due to the lengthened growing season associated with global warming is probably responsible for such an increase. The response of Rh to warming is consistent with that of NPP. The magnitude of increased Rh is larger than that of NPP in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Permafrost soils in these high latitudes, which contain an enormous quantity of organic carbon, may melt with the increasing temperature, which is expected to cause increased Rh due to more dissolved organic carbon. Change in atmospheric CO2 concentration is a dominant driving factor in the spatiotemporal pattern of carbon fluxes of the terrestrial ecosystem, and its impact significantly supersedes the effects of climate change. It should be noted that the model neglects the impact of nitrogen limitation, and thus the effects of elevated CO2 on carbon fluxes might be overestimated. In addition, the contribution of climate change is not negligible, particularly in the Amazon basin, because reduction in precipitation and soil moisture can result in decreases in NPP and Rh. In this region, the model estimates that, in response to both rising CO2 concentration and climate change, the total NPP and Rh decrease by approximately-1. 8 gC m-2 a-2 and 1. 6 gC m-2 a-2, respectively. NEP also shows a decreased trend, but most areas of NEP change are not statistically significant at the 5% level. In this region, NEP change is closely related to the variation of temperature, precipitation and soil moisture, and the change correlates more to soil moisture than the other two variables. This indicates that drought is key factor driving NEP changes in this region. The terrestrial carbon fluxes are also driven by multiple factors, e. g. radiation, and the processes involved are complicated. Land use and the effect of aerosol are not considered in this paper. These factors should be incorporated into longer-term simulations to investigate the mechanisms involved in the response of the terrestrial carbon fluxes to CO2 concentration and climate change. © 2016 Ecological Society of China.

With the growth of population and technological expertise and the declining emission-to-output ratio described in the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, the projected carbon emission is 13.7 Gt C, resulting in a 2.4 °C warming by the end of the twenty-first century (2080–2099) compared with 1980–1999.

We set up an Earth System Model, which is named as the First Institute of Oceanography-Earth System Model (FIO-ESM), composed of a coupled physical climate model and a coupled carbon cycle model. A surface wave model is introduced through including the nonbreaking wave-induced vertical mixing, which can improve the performance of climate model especially in the simulation of upper ocean mixed layer depth in the southern ocean, into the ocean general circulation model. The FIO-ESM is employed to conduct Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments. The historical simulation of FIO-ESM's physical climate model for 1850-2005 shows that the simulated patterns of surface air temperature (SAT), rainfall, and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) match those of the observations. Future projections under the four scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 are also conducted and the global averaged SAT in 2100 would be -0.007°C, 1.10°C, 1.85°C, and 3.92°C higher than that in 2005, respectively. The historical simulation and future projection under RCP8.5 with global carbon cycle show the SAT and atmospheric CO2 concentration are well reproduced in the historical period and the global averaged SAT would increase by 3.90°C in 2100, which is quite similar to the physical climate model's result. Further analysis shows surface wave makes projected SAT in RCP2.6 about 2°C cooler in the Arctic area and 2°C warmer in the southern ocean. © 2013. American Geophysical Union.

However, there are large discrepancies in the estimated contributions to this sea level change from various sources (the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and smaller ice caps). Here, we determine probabilistically the likely contribution of Greenland ice sheet melt to Last Interglacial sea level rise, taking into account ice sheet model parametric uncertainty. We perform an ensemble of 500 Glimmer ice sheet model simulations forced with climatologies from the climate model HadCM3, and constrain the results with palaeodata from Greenland ice cores. Our results suggest a 90% probability that Greenland ice melt contributed at least 0.6 m, but less than 10% probability that it exceeded 3.5 m, a value which is lower than several recent estimates. Many of these previous estimates, however, did not include a full general circulation climate model that can capture atmospheric circulation and precipitation changes in response to changes in insolation forcing and orographic height. Our combined modelling and palaeodata approach suggests that the Greenland ice sheet is less sensitive to orbital forcing than previously thought, and it implicates Antarctic melt as providing a substantial contribution to Last Interglacial sea level rise. Future work should assess additional uncertainty due to inclusion of basal sliding and the direct effect of insolation on surface melt. In addition, the effect of uncertainty arising from climate model structural design should be taken into account by performing a multi-climate-model comparison. © Author(s) 2013.","","Arctic; Greenland; atmospheric circulation; circulation modeling; climate modeling; ice sheet; Last Interglacial; sea level; sea level change","E.J.

Here, we probe the sensitivity of a comprehensive Earth system model (GFDL-ESM2M) to three different atmospheric CO2 concentration pathways, two of which arrive at 1.5 K of warming in 2100 by very different pathways. We run five ensemble members of each of these simulations: (1) a standard Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5) scenario, which produces 2 K of surface warming by 2100 in our model; (2) a stabilization pathway in which atmospheric CO2 concentration never exceeds 440 ppm and the global mean temperature rise is approximately 1.5 K by 2100; and (3) an overshoot pathway that passes through 2 K of warming at mid-century, before ramping down atmospheric CO2 concentrations, as if using carbon removal, to end at 1.5 K of warming at 2100. Although the global mean surface temperature change in response to the overshoot pathway is similar to the stabilization pathway in 2100, this similarity belies several important differences in other climate metrics, such as warming over land masses, the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), ocean acidification, sea ice coverage, and the global mean sea level change and its regional expressions. In 2100, the overshoot ensemble shows a greater global steric sea level rise and weaker AMOC mass transport than in the stabilization scenario, with both of these metrics close to the ensemble mean of RCP4.5. There is strong ocean surface cooling in the North Atlantic Ocean and Southern Ocean in response to overshoot forcing due to perturbations in the ocean circulation. Thus, overshoot forcing in this model reduces the rate of sea ice loss in the Labrador, Nordic, Ross, and Weddell seas relative to the stabilized pathway, suggesting a negative radiative feedback in response to the early rapid warming. Finally, the ocean perturbation in response to warming leads to strong pathway dependence of sea level rise in northern North American cities, with overshoot forcing producing up to 10 cm of additional sea level rise by 2100 relative to stabilization forcing. © 2018 Author(s).","","Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Labrador Sea; Norwegian Sea; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean; Weddell Sea; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Sea ice; Sea level; Stabilization; Atlantic meridional overturning circulations; CO2 concentration; Earth system model; Global mean sea levels; Global mean surface temperature; Global-mean temperature; North Atlantic Ocean; Ocean acidifications; climate change; climate modeling; concentration (composition); ensemble forecasting; mass transport; North Atlantic Oscillation; oceanic circulation; overturn; perturbation; sea level change; stabilization; warming; Climate change","J.B.

Twenty-one years (1993-2013) of satellite altimetry data, represented by dynamic topography (DT), are examined in light of tide-gauge observations. Current DT changes are examined with respect to five atmospheric/oceanic factors. The qualities of three realizations of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model are examined by comparing these with DT. Finally, the simulations best describing the present DT are used to describe projected sea-level changes in the study area. The results indicate that DT can be used to study coastal and deep-water sea-level changes in the study area. The southern Levantine sub-basin sea level has recently risen by an average of 3.1 cm decade-1 and exhibits significant annual sea-level variation of -17 cm to 8 cm. The sea-level variation is significantly affected by several factors: sea-level variation west of the Gibraltar Strait, steric sea level, and sea-surface temperature. The GFDL simulations best describing the recent sea level over the study area, i.e., GFDL-CM3 and GFDL-ESM2M, are used to calculate the two-model ensemble mean (GFDL-2ENM), which indicates that Egypt's Mediterranean coast will experience substantial sea-level rise (SLR) this century. The estimated uncertainty over the study area was 4-22 cm by 2100, with the emission assumptions dominating the three sources of uncertainty sources. Comparing the projected SLRs with digital elevation data indicates that Egypt's Mediterranean coast will only be safe from flooding by 2100 if effective adaptation methods are applied. © 2015 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.","Climate change; Egyptian Mediterranean coast; Nile Delta; Sea level","Egypt; Mediterranean Coast [Egypt]; Nile Delta; climate change; coastal zone; flooding; satellite altimetry; sea level change","M.

Previous studies have simulated the event using ice sheet and/or iceberg meltwater forcing, but these idealized freshwater fluxes have been unrealistically large. Here we use a different approach, driving a high-resolution drainage network model with a recent time-resolved global paleo-ice sheet reconstruction to generate a realistic meltwater forcing. We input this flux to the Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3 (HadCM3) climate model without adjusting the timing or amplitude and find that an acceleration in northern ice sheet melting (up to ~7.5 m/kyr global mean sea level rise equivalent) triggers a 20% reduction in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The simulated pattern of ocean circulation and climate change matches an array of paleoclimate and ocean circulation reconstructions for the onset of Heinrich Stadial 1, in terms of both rates and magnitude of change. This is achieved with a meltwater flux that matches constraints on sea level changes and ice sheet evolution around 19–18 ka. Since the rates of melting are similar to those projected for Greenland by 2200, constraining the melt rates and magnitude of climate change during Heinrich Stadial 1 would provide an important test of climate model sensitivity to future ice sheet melt. ©2018.

This makes it difficult to quantify the forced response to external forcing. Here we analyze two large ensembles of simulations from 1950 to 2100 by two fully-coupled climate models, namely the CESM1 and CanESM2, to quantify ICV’s influences on estimated trends in annual surface air temperature (Tas) and precipitation (P) over different time periods. Results show that the observed trends since 1979 in global-mean Tas and P are within the spread of the CESM1-simulated trends while the CanESM2 overestimates the historical changes, likely due to its deficiencies in simulating historical non-CO2 forcing. Both models show considerable spreads in the Tas and P trends among the individual simulations, and the spreads decrease rapidly as the record length increases to about 40 (50) years for global-mean Tas (P). Because of ICV, local and regional P trends may remain statistically insignificant and differ greatly among individual model simulations over most of the globe until the later part of the twenty-first century even under a high emissions scenario, while local Tas trends since 1979 are already statistically significant over many low-latitude regions and are projected to become significant over most of the globe by the 2030s. The largest influences of ICV come from the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation and polar sea ice. In contrast to the realization-dependent ICV, the forced Tas response to external forcing has a temporal evolution that is similar over most of the globe (except its amplitude). For annual precipitation, however, the temporal evolution of the forced response is similar (opposite) to that of Tas over many mid-high latitude areas and the ITCZ (subtropical regions), but close to zero over the transition zones between the regions with positive and negative trends. The ICV in the transient climate change simulations is slightly larger than that in the control run for P (and other related variables such as water vapor), but similar for Tas. Thus, the ICV for P from a control run may need to be scaled up in detection and attribution analyses. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CanESM2; CESM1; Ensemble simulations; Internal variability; Precipitation; Temperature; Trends","","A.

The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) is applied to evaluate selected climate phenomena in the models against observations. This is the first systematic application of the ESMValTool to assess and document the progress made during an extensive model development and improvement project. This study focuses on the South Asian monsoon (SAM) and the West African monsoon (WAM), the coupled equatorial climate, and Southern Ocean clouds and radiation, which are known to exhibit systematic biases in present-day ESMs. The analysis shows that the tropical precipitation in three out of four models is clearly improved. Two of three updated coupled models show an improved representation of tropical sea surface temperatures with one coupled model not exhibiting a double Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Simulated cloud amounts and cloud-radiation interactions are improved over the Southern Ocean. Improvements are also seen in the simulation of the SAM and WAM, although systematic biases remain in regional details and the timing of monsoon rainfall. Analysis of simulations with EC-Earth at different horizontal resolutions from T159 up to T1279 shows that the synoptic-scale variability in precipitation over the SAM and WAM regions improves with higher model resolution. The results suggest that the reasonably good agreement of modeled and observed mean WAM and SAM rainfall in lower-resolution models may be a result of unrealistic intensity distributions.","","Southern Ocean; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Earth (planet); Oceanography; Rain; Surface waters; Tropics; Analysis of simulations; Cloud-radiation interactions; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Intensity distribution; Intertropical convergence zone; Sea surface temperature (SST); Synoptic scale variability; Tropical precipitation; climate modeling; CMIP; intertropical convergence zone; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; regional climate; sea surface temperature; tropical meteorology; Climate models","A.

ISMIP6 conducts stand-alone ice sheet experiments that use space- and time-varying forcing derived from atmosphere-ocean coupled global climate models (AOGCMs) to reflect plausible trajectories for climate projections. The goal of this study is to recommend a subset of CMIP5 AOGCMs (three core and three targeted) to produce forcing for ISMIP6 stand-alone ice sheet simulations, based on (i) their representation of current climate near Antarctica and Greenland relative to observations and (ii) their ability to sample a diversity of projected atmosphere and ocean changes over the 21st century. The selection is performed separately for Greenland and Antarctica. Model evaluation over the historical period focuses on variables used to generate ice sheet forcing. For stage (i), we combine metrics of atmosphere and surface ocean state (annual- and seasonal-mean variables over large spatial domains) with metrics of time-mean subsurface ocean temperature biases averaged over sectors of the continental shelf. For stage (ii), we maximize the diversity of climate projections among the best-performing models. Model selection is also constrained by technical limitations, such as availability of required data from RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 projections. The selected top three CMIP5 climate models are CCSM4, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M for Antarctica and HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M for Greenland. This model selection was designed specifically for ISMIP6 but can be adapted for other applications. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

Compared to the original relationship used in HadGEM2-AO, which utilized observed data from only limited regions, this new relationship provides a lower Nd than the original relationship for Naer < 680 cm-3, and the opposite for Naer > 680 cm-3. The complete historical run with the new relationship (newHIST) shows a number of significant differences from the original historical run (HIST). Nd increased in industrialized regions while it generally decreased over the oceanic regions in newHIST compared to HIST. Interestingly, in newHIST a significant change in total cloud amount occurred mainly in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) due to a change in the wind circulation pattern over the North Pacific. Notably, the surface temperature in newHIST was closer to the observational data than that in HIST - especially over the Northern Hemisphere. Despite the small change in Nd in the new relationship, not only the variables directly associated with cloud microphysics but also the variables representing atmospheric circulation patterns changed significantly. This implies that accurate parameterization of Nd is critical for better climate model prediction. © Inter-Research 2016.","Aerosol activation; Climate model; Cloud droplet number concentration","oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); aerosol; atmospheric circulation; climate modeling; cloud droplet; cloud microphysics; concentration (composition); empirical analysis; industrial location; intertropical convergence zone; parameterization; surface temperature; wind-driven circulation","S.S.

An ESM version of the Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System model (FGOALS) was recently developed within the IPCC AR5 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) modeling framework, and we describe the development of this model through the coupling of a dynamic global vegetation and terrestrial carbon model with FGOALS-s2. The performance of the coupled model is evaluated as follows. The simulated global total terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) is 124.4 PgC yr-1 and net primary production (NPP) is 50.9 PgC yr-1. The entire terrestrial carbon pools contain about 2009.9 PgC, comprising 628.2 PgC and 1381.6 PgC in vegetation and soil pools, respectively. Spatially, in the tropics, the seasonal cycle of NPP and net ecosystem production (NEP) exhibits a dipole mode across the equator due to migration of the monsoon rainbelt, while the seasonal cycle is not so significant in Leaf Area Index (LAI). In the subtropics, especially in the East Asian monsoon region, the seasonal cycle is obvious due to changes in temperature and precipitation from boreal winter to summer. Vegetation productivity in the northern mid-high latitudes is too low, possibly due to low soil moisture there. On the interannual timescale, the terrestrial ecosystem shows a strong response to ENSO. The model-simulated Niño3.4 index and total terrestrial NEP are both characterized by a broad spectral peak in the range of 2-7 years. Further analysis indicates their correlation coefficient reaches -0.7 when NEP lags the Niño3.4 index for about 1-2 months. © 2013 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","carbon cycle; Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM); Earth System Model (ESM); interannual variability; seasonal cycle","","Q.

Stratospheric sulfate injection (SSI) is a geoengineering method proposed to reduce planetary warming by reflecting a proportion of solar radiation back into space that would otherwise warm the surface and lower atmosphere. The authors analyze results from the Met Office Hadley Centre Global Environment Model, version 2, Carbon Cycle Stratosphere (HadGEM2-CCS) climate model with stratospheric emissions of 10 Tg yr-1 of SO2, designed to offset global temperature rise by around 1°C. A reduction in concentrating solar power output of 5.9% on average over land is shown under SSI relative to a baseline future climate change scenario (RCP4.5) caused by a decrease in direct radiation. Solar photovoltaic energy is generally less affected as it can use diffuse radiation, which increases under SSI, at the expense of direct radiation. The results from HadGEM2-CCS are compared with the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model (GEOSCCM) from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), with 5 Tg yr-1 emission of SO2. In many regions, the differences predicted in solar energy output between the SSI and RCP4.5 simulations are robust, as the sign of the changes for both HadGEM2-CCS and GEOSCCM agree. Furthermore, the sign of the total and direct annual mean radiation changes evaluated by HadGEM2-CCS agrees with the sign of the multimodel mean changes of an ensemble of GeoMIP models over the majority of the world. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Climate models; General circulation models; Radiative fluxes; Renewable energy; Shortwave radiation","Carbon; Climate models; Earth (planet); Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Radiation; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sulfur dioxide; Chemistry-climate models; Concentrating solar power; General circulation model; Goddard earth observing systems; Radiative fluxes; Renewable energies; Short-wave radiation; Solar photovoltaic energies; climate change; climate modeling; ensemble forecasting; general circulation model; photovoltaic system; radiative transfer; renewable resource; shortwave radiation; solar power; stratosphere; sulfate; Climate change","C.J.

To construct a predictive tool designed to address this problem, a multifaceted approach based on paleogeographic mapping integrated with Earth-systems modeling has been devised and applied for a series of 18 time slices from the Early Paleozoic to Recent. Plate Wizard™ reconstructions were used as the basis for global paleogeographic mapping. Detailed paleotectonic and paleoenvironment maps were prepared using a global database of paleoenvironmental and lithofacies data compiled for this project. A novel method relating topography and bathymetry to plate tectonic environments was used in the construction of paleo digital elevation models (DEMs), and these DEMs were coupled with state-of-the-art paleo-Earth systems models (UK Meteorological Office HadCM3 paleoclimate model) run specifically for this project. The database also included climate proxies that were used to test the veracity of modeling results. Both upwelling and storms are major factors in the supply of nutrients to the photic zone, and low light levels are a significant seasonal limit on primary productivity, particularly at high latitudes. Each of these elements of the predictive model was derived from the HadCM3 model output. This approach also provides an understanding of paleogeographic and paleoclimatic geohistory that includes drainage basin evolution.

Moisture budget analysis is applied to explain the precipitation biases. FGOALS-g2 and FGOALS-s2 both underestimate precipitation over the continental monsoon trough but overestimate precipitation over the adjacent ocean. The northward seasonal migration of continental convergence zone is weaker than observation. The east-west sea surface temperature (SST) biases in the equatorial Indian Ocean (IO) simulated by FGOALS-g2 lead to weak southern intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) over the eastern equatorial IO, while the south-north SST biases over the IO simulated by FGOALS-s2 result in southwestward shift of the ITCZ. Moisture budget analysis shows that precipitation biases in the FGOALS models are mainly attributed to the convergence of vertically integrated moisture flux biases, especially biases in the vertical dynamic moisture transport term. On the one hand, cold SST biases in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal along with warm SST biases in the tropical western IO reduce moisture flux over the Indian subcontinent in both models. On the other hand, cold biases of tropospheric temperature in the FGOALS models are most prominent in the upper troposphere over northern India. The FGOALS models also simulate weak longwave cloud radiative effects over the monsoon trough region due to their negative biases of cloud fraction over South Asia. The subsiding branches linked with the reduced meridional tropospheric temperature gradient and strengthened gross moist stability decrease climatological precipitation in the continental monsoon trough region. The FGOALS models cannot reasonably simulate the ENSO-SASM relationship at interannual time scale. The descending branch of the anomalous Walker circulation and corresponding negative precipitation anomalies are shifted to the tropical central-western IO to the south of the equator. The heating anomalies asymmetric about the equator enhance the northward cross-equatorial monsoon circulation and further cause erroneous positive precipitation anomalies over southern India. The shifts of the anomalous Walker circulation and negative precipitation anomalies are associated with the model biases in simulating climatological precipitation over the southern tropical IO. Our results show that reducing IO SST biases, tropospheric temperature biases and cloud biases is necessary for better simulation of mean state SASM by climate system models. On interannual time scale, the reasonable simulation of ENSO-monsoon relationship relies on successful simulation of climatological precipitation over the tropical IO and ENSO related circulation anomalies. © 2019, Science Press.

The budget terms are decomposed to isolate the MJO influence and the ocean current associated with Kelvin waves. Using this decomposition, one can distinguish between El Niño events with strong and weak MJO influence. Composites of El Niño events based on the wind power component associated with the MJO induced wind stress and oceanic Kelvin waves (W MJO , K) are compared with composites based only on the atmospheric variability and based only on the oceanic variability. It was found that the composite of events when W MJO , K is near maximum (+ NMJO,K) shows a greater magnitude of mean perturbation wind power, buoyancy power, and available potential energy than any other case, which is consistent with the greater amplitude Kelvin wave perturbations on the thermocline, as well as the greater amplitude of SST anomalies at the peak of the event. For + NMJO,K, latent heat flux anomalies out of the ocean along the coast of New Guinea are seen coincident with deepening of the mixed layer depth there, suggesting that this is an important region for the thermodynamic influence of the MJO on the ocean.

Changes in the AMOC can have a significant impact on the global climate. Sustained warming due to increased greenhouse gas emissions is projected to weaken the AMOC, which in turn can lead to changes in the location of Inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), oceanic and atmospheric large-scale circulation, tropical precipitation and regional monsoons. Using proxy records, observations and CMIP6 simulations of IITM Earth System Model (IITM-ESM), we investigate the changes in the AMOC and associated changes in the large-scale circulation and precipitation patterns over the South Asian monsoon region. Transient CO2 simulation and additional model sensitivity experiments with realistic surface heat and freshwater perturbation anomalies under the experimental protocol of Flux Anomaly Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (FAFMIP) performed with IITM-ESM reveal a decline in the strength of AMOC. The weakening of AMOC is associated with enhanced heat and freshwater forcing in the North Atlantic resulting in the reduction of northward oceanic heat transport and an enhanced northward atmospheric heat transport. Changes in AMOC lead to weakening of large-scale north–south temperature gradient and regional land-sea thermal gradient, which in turn weaken the regional Hadley circulation and, monsoon circulation over the South Asian region. Both the FAFMIP and transient CO2 experiments reveal consistent results of weakening South Asian Monsoon circulation with a decline of AMOC, while precipitation exhibits contrasting responses as precipitation changes are dominated by the thermodynamic response. The suite of observational and numerical analysis provides a mechanistic hypothesis for the weakening of South Asian monsoon circulation concomitant with a weakening of AMOC in a warming climate. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Atlantic meridional overturning circulation; Global warming; Heat transport; South Asian monsoon; Weakening of circulation","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); South Asia; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; CMIP; global climate; greenhouse gas; Hadley cell; heat flow; intertropical convergence zone; meridional circulation; monsoon; overturn; precipitation (climatology); regional climate","N.

Thailand's coastlines is also likely to face erosion, especially in the low-lying areas, and its future projection due to sea level rise is necessary. This study compiled a database of beach characteristics, including grain size diameter, beach slope and beach width, to assess the projections of future beach loss along Thailand's coastlines against sea level rise scenarios of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in 2081-2100, relative to a reference period 1986-2005 by using the Bruun rule. Future national beach loss rates were projected to be 45.8% for RCP2.6, 55.0% for RCP4.5, 56.9% for RCP6.0 and 71.8% for RCP8.5. In addition, the rate against the sea level scenarios projected by each CMIP5 model for RCP4.5 ranges from 49.1% for MPI-ESM-LR to 73.4% for MIROC-ESM-CHEM. Based on the current beach situation, sandy beaches in 8 and 23 out of 51 zones will disappear for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively.

The model represents a major advance on its predecessor HadGEM2-ES, with enhancements to all component models and new feedback mechanisms. These include a new core physical model with a well-resolved stratosphere; terrestrial biogeochemistry with coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles and enhanced land management; tropospheric-stratospheric chemistry allowing the holistic simulation of radiative forcing from ozone, methane, and nitrous oxide; two-moment, five-species, modal aerosol; and ocean biogeochemistry with two-way coupling to the carbon cycle and atmospheric aerosols. The complexity of coupling between the ocean, land, and atmosphere physical climate and biogeochemical cycles in UKESM1 is unprecedented for an Earth system model. We describe in detail the process by which the coupled model was developed and tuned to achieve acceptable performance in key physical and Earth system quantities and discuss the challenges involved in mitigating biases in a model with complex connections between its components. Overall, the model performs well, with a stable pre-industrial state and good agreement with observations in the latter period of its historical simulations. However, global mean surface temperature exhibits stronger-than-observed cooling from 1950 to 1970, followed by rapid warming from 1980 to 2014. Metrics from idealized simulations show a high climate sensitivity relative to previous generations of models: Equilibrium climate sensitivity is 5.4 K, transient climate response ranges from 2.68 to 2.85 K, and transient climate response to cumulative emissions is 2.49 to 2.66 K TtC−1. ©2019.

Since, in the global context, Brazil is one of the regions with higher fire activity, an assessment is here performed of the sensitivity of the wildfire regime in Brazilian savanna and shrubland areas to changes in regional climate during the 21st Century, for an intermediate scenario (RCP4.5) of climate change. The assessment is based on a spatial and temporal analysis of a meteorological fire danger index specifically developed for Brazilian biomes, which was evaluated based on regional climate simulations of temperature, relative humidity and precipitation using the Rossby Centre Regional Climate Model (RCA4) forced by the EC-Earth earth system model. Results show a systematic increase in the extreme levels of fire danger throughout the 21st Century that mainly results from the increase in maximum daily temperature, which rises by about 2 °C between 2005 and 2100.

The climate-forcing fields are obtained from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme project ice2sea, in which three regional climate models are used to dynamically downscale two scenarios (A1B and E1) from two general circulation models (ECHAM5 and HadCM3). To assess the sensitivity of the projections to the model initial state, four initialization methods are applied. In these experiments, the simulated contribution to sea-level rise by 2100 ranges from an equivalent of 0.2 to 6.8 cm. The largest uncertainties arise from different formulations of the regional climate models (0.8-3.9 cm) and applied scenarios (0.65-1.9 cm), but an important source of uncertainty is the initialization method (0.1-0.8 cm). These model simulations do not account for the recently observed acceleration of ice streams and consequent thinning rates, the changing ice discharge that may result from the spatial and temporal variability of ocean forcing, or the feedback occurring between ice-sheet elevation changes and climate forcing. Thus the results should be considered the lower limit of Greenland ice sheet contributions to sea-level rise, until such processes have been integrated into large-scale ice-sheet models.","Ice and climate; Ice-sheet modeling","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; climate modeling; computer simulation; general circulation model; ice sheet; mass movement; modeling; regional climate; sea level change; twenty first century",""

Two experiments were performed with alternative descriptions of past vegetation: (i) one in which potential natural vegetation was simulated by Top-down Representation of Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics (TRIFFID) but without land use changes and (ii) one where the anthropogenic land use model Kaplan and Krumhardt 2010 (KK10; Kaplan et al., 2009, 2011) was used to set the HadCM3 crop regions. Snapshot simulations were run at 1000-year intervals to examine when the first signature of anthropogenic climate change can be detected both regionally, in the areas of land use change, and globally. Results from our model simulations indicate that in regions of early land disturbance such as Europe and south-east Asia detectable temperature changes, outside the normal range of variability, are encountered in the model as early as 7 ka BP in the June-July-August (JJA) season and throughout the entire annual cycle by 2-3 ka BP. Areas outside the regions of land disturbance are also affected, with virtually the whole globe experiencing significant temperature changes (predominantly cooling) by the early industrial period. The global annual mean temperature anomalies found in our single model simulations were -0.22 at 1850 CE, -0.11 at 2 ka BP, and -0.03 °C at 7 ka BP. Regionally, the largest temperature changes were in Europe with anomalies of -0.83 at 1850 CE, -0.58 at 2 ka BP, and -0.24 °C at 7 ka BP. Large-scale precipitation features such as the Indian monsoon, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and the North Atlantic storm track are also impacted by local land use and remote teleconnections. We investigated how advection by surface winds, mean sea level pressure (MSLP) anomalies, and tropospheric stationary wave train disturbances in the mid- to high latitudes led to remote teleconnections. © Author(s) 2016.","","Asia; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Europe; annual cycle; anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; deforestation; emission; environmental disturbance; geophysical survey; global climate; Holocene; land use change; methane; paleoclimate; sea level pressure; standing wave; teleconnection","M.C.

We found that the PWC shows a significant interannual weakening after SVEs. The cooling effect from SVEs is able to cool the entire tropics. However, cooling over the Maritime Continent is stronger than that over the central-eastern tropical Pacific. Thus, non-uniform zonal temperature anomalies can be seen following SVEs. As a result, the sea level pressure gradient between the tropical Pacific and the Maritime Continent is reduced, which weakens trade winds over the tropical Pacific. Therefore, the PWC is weakened during this period. At the same time, due to the cooling subtropical and midlatitude Pacific, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) are weakened and shift to the equator. These changes also contribute to the weakened PWC. Meanwhile, through the positive Bjerknes feedback, weakened trade winds cause El Niño-like SST anomalies over the tropical Pacific, which in turn further influence the PWC. Therefore, the PWC significantly weakens after SVEs. The CAM4 experiments further confirm the influences from surface cooling over the Maritime Continent and subtropical/midlatitude Pacific on the PWC. Moreover, they indicate that the stronger cooling over the Maritime Continent plays a dominant role in weakening the PWC after SVEs. In the observations, a weakened PWC and a related El Niño-like SST pattern can be found following SVEs. © 2018, Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cooling effect; Pacific Walker circulation; strong tropical volcanic eruptions; trade winds","","T.

Box 3000, United States","Earth system models simulate prominent terrestrial carbon-cycle responses to anthropogenically forced changes in climate and atmospheric composition over the twenty-first century. The rate and magnitude of the forced climate change is routinely evaluated relative to unforced, or natural, variability using a multi-member ensemble of simulations. However, Earth system model carbon-cycle analyses do not account for unforced variability. To investigate unforced terrestrial carbon-cycle variability, we analyse ensembles from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), focusing on the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4). The unforced variability of CCSM4 is comparable to that observed at the Harvard Forest eddy covariance flux tower site. Over the twenty-first century, unforced variability in land-atmosphere CO2 flux is larger than the forced response at decadal timescales in many areas of the world, precluding detection of the forced carbon-cycle change. Only after several decades does the forced carbon signal consistently emerge in CCSM4 and other models for the business-as-usual radiative forcing scenario (RCP8.5). Grid-cell variability in time of emergence is large, but decreases at regional scales. To attribute changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle to anthropogenic forcings, monitoring networks and model projections must consider the timescale at which the forced biogeochemical response emerges from the natural variability.© 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Atmospheric CO2 concentration is calculated from a prognostic equation taking into account global anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the interactive CO2 exchanges of land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere. When forced by prescribed historical emissions of CO 2 from combustion of fossil fuels and land use change, BCC-CSM1.1 can reproduce the trends of observed atmospheric CO2 concentration and global surface air temperature from 1850 to 2005. Simulated interannual variability and long-term trend of global carbon sources and sinks and their spatial patterns generally agree with other model estimates and observations, which shows the following: (1) Both land and ocean in the last century act as net carbon sinks. The ability of carbon uptake by land and ocean is enhanced at the end of last century. (2) Interannual variability of the global atmospheric CO2 concentration is closely correlated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation cycle, in agreement with observations. (3) Interannual variation of the land-to-atmosphere net carbon flux is positively correlated with surface air temperature while negatively correlated with soil moisture over low and midlatitudes. The relative contribution of soil moisture to the interannual variation of land-atmosphere CO2 exchange is more important than that of air temperature over tropical regions, while surface air temperature is more important than soil moisture over other regions of the globe.

This new version (here termed NorESM1-F) runs about 2.5 times faster (e.g., 90 model years per day on current hardware) than the version that contributed to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison project (CMIP5), i.e., NorESM1-M, and is therefore particularly suitable for multimillennial paleoclimate and carbon cycle simulations or large ensemble simulations. The speed-up is primarily a result of using a prescribed atmosphere aerosol chemistry and a tripolar ocean-sea ice horizontal grid configuration that allows an increase of the ocean-sea ice component time steps. Ocean biogeochemistry can be activated for fully coupled and semi-coupled carbon cycle applications. This paper describes the model and evaluates its performance using observations and NorESM1-M as benchmarks. The evaluation emphasizes model stability, important large-scale features in the ocean and sea ice components, internal variability in the coupled system, and climate sensitivity. Simulation results from NorESM1-F in general agree well with observational estimates and show evident improvements over NorESM1-M, for example, in the strength of the meridional overturning circulation and sea ice simulation, both important metrics in simulating past and future climates. Whereas NorESM1-M showed a slight global cool bias in the upper oceans, NorESM1-F exhibits a global warm bias. In general, however, NorESM1-F has more similarities than dissimilarities compared to NorESM1-M, and some biases and deficiencies known in NorESM1-M remain. © Author(s) 2019.","","aerosol; benchmarking; carbon cycle; CMIP; meridional circulation; model; overturn; paleoclimate; sea ice; simulation; upper ocean","C.

Prevailing hypotheses variously infer (1) insolation-controlled asymmetry of wet phases between hemispheres, (2) symmetric contraction and expansion of the tropical rainbelt, and (3) independent control on moisture available in Southern Africa via sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean. In this study we use climate-model simulations covering the last glacial cycle (120. kyr) with HadCM3 and the multi-model ensembles from PMIP3 (the Palaeoclimate Model Intercomparison Project) to investigate the long-term behaviour of the African rainbelt, and test these simulations against existing empirical palaeohydrological records. Through regional model-data comparisons we find evidence for the validity of several hypotheses, with various proposed processes occurring concurrently but with different regional emphasis (e.g. asymmetric shifts at the seasonal extremes and symmetric expansions/contractions towards West equatorial regions). Crucially, variations in rainfall are associated with multiple forcing mechanisms that vary in their dominance both spatially and temporally over the glacial cycle an important consideration when interpreting and extrapolating from often relatively short palaeoenvironmental records. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Africa; Climate change; Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ); Quaternary; Tropical rainbelt","Africa; Indian Ocean; Climate change; Glacial geology; Moisture control; Oceanography; Rain; Surface waters; Tropics; Africa; Climate model simulations; Contraction and expansion; Intertropical convergence zone; Precipitation variability; Quaternary; Rainbelt; Sea surface temperature (SST); climate modeling; climate variation; intertropical convergence zone; paleoenvironment; paleohydrology; precipitation intensity; Quaternary; rainband; sea surface temperature; Climate models","J.S.

The CAS FGOALS-f3-L model team submitted the piControl run with a near equilibrium ocean state for 561 model years, and 160-year integrations for three ensemble members of abrupt-4× CO2 and 1pctCO2, respectively. The ensemble members restart from the 600, 650 and 700 model years in the piControl run, respectively. The baseline performances of the model are validated in this article. The preliminary evaluation suggests that the CAS FGOALS-f3-L model can preserve the long-term stability well for a mean net radiation flux of 0.31 W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere, and a limited decreasing trend of −0.03 W m−2/100 yr. The global annual mean SST is 16.45°C for the 561-year mean, with an increase of 0.03°C/100 yr. The model captures the basic spatial patterns of climate-mean SST and precipitation, but still underestimates the SST over the warm pool. The coupled model mitigates the precipitation bias in the ITCZ compared with the results from CMIP5. Moreover, the model’s climate sensitivity represented by the equilibrium climate sensitivity has been reduced from 4.5°C in CMIP5 to 3.0°C in CMIP6. All these datasets contribute to the benchmark of model behaviors for the desired continuity of CMIP. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

In this paper, the model structure and individual components are described briefly. Further, results for the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5) pre-industrial control and historical simulations are presented to demonstrate the model's performance in terms of the mean model state and the internal variability. It is illustrated that BNU-ESM can simulate many observed features of the earth climate system, such as the climatological annual cycle of surface-air temperature and precipitation, annual cycle of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST), the overall patterns and positions of cells in global ocean meridional overturning circulation. For example, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) simulated in BNU-ESM exhibits an irregular oscillation between 2 and 5 years with the seasonal phase locking feature of ENSO. Important biases with regard to observations are presented and discussed, including warm SST discrepancies in the major upwelling regions, an equatorward drift of midlatitude westerly wind bands, and tropical precipitation bias over the ocean that is related to the double Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). © Author(s) 2014.","","Beijing [China]; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical); annual cycle; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global ocean; intertropical convergence zone; sea surface temperature; timescale; upwelling; westerly",""

Our interest is in the extent to which global terrestrial carbon pools and sinks, in particular those of the Amazonian region, are vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. CanESM2 results indicate that land remains an overall sink of atmospheric carbon for the 2006-2100 period. The net carbon uptake by land in response to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 is close to 20, 80 and 140 Pg C for the RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The latitudinal structure of future atmosphere-land CO2 flux remains similar to that observed for the historical period with northern mid-to high-latitude regions gaining carbon from the atmosphere while the tropics remain either carbon neutral or a modest source of atmospheric carbon depending on scenario. These changes occur in conjunction with simulated precipitation and soil moisture increases over northern mid-and high-latitude land regions and precipitation and soil moisture decreases over the South American continent in all scenarios. Compared to other regions of the globe, which are either carbon sinks or near neutral, the Amazonian region is simulated to be a net source of carbon during the 21st century. Moreover, and unexpectedly, the rate of carbon loss to the atmosphere from the Amazonian region is largely independent of the differences between the three scenarios considered. © 2014 Author(s).","","","V.K.

Results from four earth system models (ESMs) are analyzed for the future RCP8.5 scenario from simulations with and without land-use and land cover change (LULCC), contributing to the Land-Use and Climate, IDentification of robust impacts (LUCID) project. Over the period 2006-2100, LULCC causes the atmospheric CO2concentration to increase by 12, 22, and 66 ppm in CanESM2, MIROC-ESM, and MPI-ESM-LR, respectively. Statistically significant changes in global near-surface temperature are found in three models with a BGC-induced global mean annual warming between 0.07 and 0.23 K. BGP-induced responses are simulated by three models in areas of intense LULCC of varying sign and magnitude (between g 0.47 and 0.10 K). Modifications of the land carbon pool by LULCC are disentangled in accordance with processes that can lead to increases and decreases in this carbon pool. Global land carbon losses due to LULCC are simulated by all models: 218, 57, 35 and 34 Gt C by MPI-ESM-LR, MIROC-ESM, IPSL-CM5A-LR and CanESM2, respectively. On the contrary, the CO2-fertilization effect caused by elevated atmospheric CO2concentrations due to LULCC leads to a land carbon gain of 39 Gt C in MPI-ESM-LR and is almost negligible in the other models. A substantial part of the spread in models' responses to LULCC is attributed to the differences in implementation of LULCC (e.g., whether pastures or crops are simulated explicitly) and the simulation of specific processes. Simple idealized experiments with clear protocols for implementing LULCC in ESMs are needed to increase the understanding of model responses and the statistical significance of results, especially when analyzing the regional-scale impacts of LULCC. © Author(s) 2014.

These emissions-driven simulations are compared against the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble of physical climate system models, used extensively to inform previous assessments of regional climate change, and also against emissions-driven simulations from ESMs contributed to the CMIP5 archive. Members of our earth system perturbed parameter ensemble (ESPPE) are competitive with CMIP3 and CMIP5 models in their simulations of historical climate. In particular, they perform reasonably well in comparison with HadGEM2-ES, a more sophisticated and expensive earth system model contributed to CMIP5. The ESPPE therefore provides a computationally cost-effective tool to explore interactions between earth system processes. In response to a non-intervention emissions scenario, the ESPPE simulates distributions of future regional temperature change characterised by wide ranges, and warm shifts, compared to those of CMIP3 models. These differences partly reflect the uncertain influence of global carbon cycle feedbacks in the ESPPE. In addition, the regional effects of interactions between different earth system feedbacks, particularly involving physical and ecosystem processes, shift and widen the ESPPE spread in normalised patterns of surface temperature and precipitation change in many regions. Significant differences from CMIP3 also arise from the use of parametric perturbations (rather than a multimodel ensemble) to represent model uncertainties, and this is also the case when ESPPE results are compared against parallel emissions-driven simulations from CMIP5 ESMs. When driven by an aggressive mitigation scenario, the ESPPE and HadGEM2-ES reveal significant but uncertain impacts in limiting temperature increases during the second half of the twenty-first century. Emissions-driven simulations create scope for development of errors in properties that were previously prescribed in coupled ocean–atmosphere models, such as historical CO2 concentrations and vegetation distributions. In this context, historical intra-ensemble variations in the airborne fraction of CO2 emissions, and in summer soil moisture in northern hemisphere continental regions, are shown to be potentially useful constraints, subject to uncertainties in the relevant observations. Our results suggest that future climate-related risks can be assessed more comprehensively by updating projection methodologies to support formal combination of emissions-driven perturbed parameter and multi-model earth system model simulations with suitable observational constraints. This would provide scenarios underpinned by a more complete representation of the chain of uncertainties from anthropogenic emissions to future climate outcomes. © 2014, Crown Copyright.","Climate change projections; Earth system modelling; Ensemble methods; Model evaluation; Observational constraints; Uncertainty","",""

CNRM-ESM2-1 offers a higher model complexity than the Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model CNRM-CM6-1 by adding interactive ES components such as carbon cycle, aerosols, and atmospheric chemistry. As both models share the same code, physical parameterizations, and grid resolution, they offer a fully traceable framework to investigate how far the represented ES processes impact the model performance over present-day, response to external forcing and future climate projections. Using a large variety of CMIP6 experiments, we show that represented ES processes impact more prominently the model response to external forcing than the model performance over present-day. Both models display comparable performance at replicating modern observations although the mean climate of CNRM-ESM2-1 is slightly warmer than that of CNRM-CM6-1. This difference arises from land cover-aerosol interactions where the use of different soil vegetation distributions between both models impacts the rate of dust emissions. This interaction results in a smaller aerosol burden in CNRM-ESM2-1 than in CNRM-CM6-1, leading to a different surface radiative budget and climate. Greater differences are found when comparing the model response to external forcing and future climate projections. Represented ES processes damp future warming by up to 10% in CNRM-ESM2-1 with respect to CNRM-CM6-1. The representation of land vegetation and the CO2-water-stomatal feedback between both models explain about 60% of this difference. The remainder is driven by other ES feedbacks such as the natural aerosol feedback. ©2019.

This study focuses on a common springtime westerly wind bias in the equatorial Atlantic in seasonal hindcasts from two coupled models - ECMWF System 4 and EC-Earth v2.3 - and in hindcasts also based on System 4, but with prescribed sea-surface temperatures. The development of the equatorial westerly bias in early April is marked by a rapid transition from a wintertime easterly, cold tongue bias to a springtime westerly bias regime that displays a marked double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The transition is a seasonal feature of the model climatology (independent of initialisation date) and is associated with a seasonal increase in rainfall where a second branch of the ITCZ is produced south of the Equator. Excess off-equatorial convergence redirects the trade winds away from the Equator. Based on arguments of temporal coincidence, the results of our analysis contrast with those from previous work, and alleged causes hereto identified as the likely cause of the equatorial westerly bias in other models must be discarded. Quite in general, we find no evidence of remote influences on the development of the springtime equatorial bias in the Atlantic in the IFS-based models. Limited evidence however is presented that supports the hypothesis of an incorrect representation of the meridional equatorward flow in the marine boundary layer of the southern Atlantic as a contributing factor. Erroneous dynamical constraints on the flow upstream of the Equator may generate convergence and associated rainfall south of the Equator. This directs attention to the representation of the properties of the subtropical boundary layer as a potential source for the double ITCZ bias. © 2019 Author(s).","","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Equatorial); general circulation model; hindcasting; intertropical convergence zone; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; weather forecasting; westerly; wind measurement","J.K.P.

We investigate the precipitation response to regional changes in aerosol emissions using three coupled chemistry-climate models: NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model 3 (GFDL-CM3), NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM1), and NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE2 (GISS-E2). Our approach contrasts a long present-day control simulation from each model (up to 400 years with perpetual year 2000 or 2005 emissions) with 14 individual aerosol emissions perturbation simulations (160-240 years each). We perturb emissions of sulfur dioxide and/or carbonaceous aerosol within six world regions and assess the significance of precipitation responses relative to internal variability determined by the control simulation and across the models. Global and regional precipitation mostly increases when we reduce regional aerosol emissions in the models, with the strongest responses occurring for sulfur dioxide emissions reductions from Europe and the United States. Precipitation responses to aerosol emissions reductions are largest in the tropics and project onto the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Regressing precipitation onto an Indo-Pacific zonal sea level pressure gradient index (a proxy for ENSO) indicates that the ENSO component of the precipitation response to regional aerosol removal can be as large as 20% of the total simulated response. Precipitation increases in the Sahel in response to aerosol reductions in remote regions because an anomalous interhemispheric temperature gradient alters the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This mechanism holds across multiple aerosol reduction simulations and models. © 2018 Author(s).","","Europe; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; United States; aerosol; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; emission control; intertropical convergence zone; precipitation assessment; sea level pressure; sulfur dioxide; sulfur emission; temperature gradient","D.M.

Here, a coupled climate model, HadGEM2-ES, is used to investigate the response to idealised energy perturbations in the tropics and extratropics, in both the northern and southern hemispheres, through the imposition of stratospheric aerosols that reflect incoming radiation. The impact on the tropical climate of high and low latitude forcing strongly contrasts, with large changes in tropical precipitation and modulation of the DI bias when the tropics are cooled as precipitation moves away from the cooled hemisphere. These responses are muted when the extratropics are cooled, as the meridional energy transport anomalies that are excited by these energy budget anomalies are partitioned between the atmosphere and ocean. The results here highlight the persistence of the DI bias in HadGEM2-ES, indicating why little progress has been made in rectifying these problems through many generations of climate models. A highly linear relationship between cross-equatorial atmospheric energy transport, tropical precipitation asymmetry and tropical sea surface temperature biases is also demonstrated, giving some suggestion as to where improvements in these large scale, persistent biases may be achieved. © 2018, The Author(s).","Climate models; Energy transport; Extratropics; ITCZ; Tropics","aerosol; albedo; climate effect; climate modeling; energy budget; extratropical environment; intertropical convergence zone; perturbation; radiation budget; tropical environment","M.

This study utilizes an experimental approach to test the hypothesis that seasonally varying climatological wind stress directly contributes to the SST and ITCZ biases in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Results show that removing the wind stress annual cycle from the ocean forcing, without constraining the atmosphere and ocean dynamics or buoyancy coupling in the NCAR CCSM4/CESM1.2.0 models, results in a remarkable reduction in the SST annual cycle and springtime ITCZ biases. Improvements in the SST occur primarily because wind-driven errors in the variability of horizontal temperature advection are damped. The ITCZ problem is closely tied to biases in the wind-driven near-equatorial SST. Additional model experiments and analyses reveal that the contributions from zonal and meridional wind stress to the biases are locally forced within 10°S-10°N and additive, suggesting that the biases are driven by independent processes. The zonal and meridional components drive different aspects of the SST annual cycle bias and contribute to the springtime ITCZ bias in different zonal locations. Both the atmosphere and ocean components of the model, separately, are shown to produce unfavorable ocean surface conditions for the simulation of a realistic springtime ITCZ, deeming this a coupled problem. Results show that wind stress may act as a pathway for process-based errors in climate models to directly drive SST and ITCZ biases. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Climate models; Intertropical convergence zone; Model errors; Sea surface temperature; Seasonal cycle; Wind stress","Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (East); Errors; Oceanography; Surface waters; Wind stress; Atmospheric circulation; Climatological winds; Eastern equatorial Pacific; Experimental approaches; Intertropical convergence zone; Model errors; Sea surface temperature (SST); Seasonal cycle; air-sea interaction; climate modeling; climatology; error analysis; intertropical convergence zone; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; wind stress; Climate models","S.M.

The diffuse fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) can be affected by either a change in the atmospheric aerosol burden and/or a change in cloudiness. During the dry season, a hotspot of biomass burning on the edges of the Amazon rainforest emits a complex mixture of aerosols and their precursors and climate-active trace gases (e.g. CO                             2                             , CH                             4                             , NO                             x                              ). This creates potential for significant interactions between chemistry, aerosol, cloud, radiation and the biosphere across the Amazon region. The combined effects of biomass burning on the terrestrial carbon cycle for the present day are potentially large, yet poorly quantified. Here, we quantify such effects using the Met Office Hadley Centre Earth system model HadGEM2-ES, which provides a fully coupled framework with interactive aerosol, radiative transfer, dynamic vegetation, atmospheric chemistry and biogenic volatile organic compound emission components. Results show that for present day, defined as year 2000 climate, the overall net impact of biomass burning aerosols is to increase net primary productivity (NPP) by +80 to +105 TgC yr                             -1                             , or 1.9% to 2.7 %, over the central Amazon Basin on annual mean. For the first time we show that this enhancement is the net result of multiple competing effects: an increase in diffuse light which stimulates photosynthetic activity in the shaded part of the canopy (+65 to +110 TgC yr                             -1                             ), a reduction in the total amount of radiation (-52 to                              -1                             05 TgC yr                             -1                             ) which reduces photosynthesis and feedback from climate adjustments in response to the aerosol forcing which increases the efficiency of biochemical processes (+67 to +100 TgC yr                             -1                             ). These results illustrate that despite a modest direct aerosol effect (the sum of the first two counteracting mechanisms), the overall net impact of biomass burning aerosols on vegetation is sizeable when indirect climate feedbacks are considered. We demonstrate that capturing the net impact of aerosols on vegetation should be assessed considering the system-wide behaviour.                          © Author(s) 2019.","","Amazonia; aerosol; aerosol composition; biological production; biomass burning; climate effect; net primary production; radiative forcing; rainforest","F.F.

This paper describes the model components and their coupling, as well as various aspects of model development, including tuning, optimization, and a reproducibility strategy. We also document the stability of the model using a long control simulation, quantify the model's ability to reproduce large-scale features of the historical climate, and evaluate the response of the model to external forcing. CanESM5 is comprised of three-dimensional atmosphere (T63 spectral resolution equivalent roughly to 2.8°) and ocean (nominally 1°) general circulation models, a sea-ice model, a land surface scheme, and explicit land and ocean carbon cycle models. The model features relatively coarse resolution and high throughput, which facilitates the production of large ensembles. CanESM5 has a notably higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (5.6 K) than its predecessor, CanESM2 (3.7 K), which we briefly discuss, along with simulated changes over the historical period. CanESM5 simulations contribute to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and will be employed for climate science and service applications in Canada. © 2019 Author(s).","","Canada; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; CMIP; general circulation model; global change; spectral resolution","C.N.

Under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) predicts a 0.6-m ensemble mean of sea-level rise for the Central Pacific from the 1986–2005 to 2081–2100 epochs. Fifty downscaling simulations of the 2080–2099 period from the CMIP5 NCAR-CCSM4 model produce 2492 hurricanes around the Hawaiian Islands. In comparison with a control dataset for the 1980–1999 period, the simulated future hurricanes show a slight increase in number and a northward shift of the tracks toward the Hawaiian Islands. There are 627 hurricanes in the 2080–2099 dataset with potential impact on Oahu, and the top 24 storms selected by wind speed at the urban Honolulu coast define a scenario set for inundation mapping. A suite of spectral wave, circulation, and Boussinesq models in a nested grid system describes generation and propagation of surge and waves across the ocean as well as wave setup and runup at the coast. The interoperable package includes phase-averaged and phase-resolving processes to determine the coastal flood hazards over a range of spatial and temporal scales during a hurricane event. Since the simulated dataset corresponds to a quasi 1000-year period, barring the tail end of the distribution, the suite of inundation scenarios enables definition of flood hazard maps with return periods of up to 500 years or annual exceedance probabilities of 0.2% or greater for climate change adaptation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Hurricanes; Inundation; Sea-level rise; Storm surge; Wave runup","Hawaiian Islands; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Central); Climate models; Crack propagation; Floods; Hazards; Hurricanes; Mapping; Probability distributions; Sea level; Storms; Wind; Climate change adaptation; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Inundation; Probabilistic approaches; Sea level rise; Spatial and temporal scale; Storm surges; Wave runup; adaptive management; climate change; coastal protection; hazard assessment; hazard management; hurricane; mapping; probability; sea level change; storm; storm surge; wave runup; Climate change","K.F.

In response, geoengineering (climate engineering) strategies are proposed to artificially cool the planet. Meanwhile, as the harbor around one-third of all described marine species, coral reefs are the most sensitive ecosystem on the planet to climate change. However, until now, there is no quantitative assessment on the impacts of geoengineering on coral reefs. This study aims to model the impacts of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering on coral reefs. Design/methodology/approach: The HadGEM2-ES climate model is used to model and evaluate the impacts of stratospheric aerosol geoengineering on coral reefs. Findings: This study shows that (1) stratospheric aerosol geoengineering could significantly mitigate future coral bleaching throughout the Caribbean Sea; (2) Changes in downward solar irradiation, sea level rise and sea surface temperature caused by geoengineering implementation should have very little impacts on coral reefs; (3) Although geoengineering would prolong the return period of future hurricanes, this may still be too short to ensure coral recruitment and survival after hurricane damage. Originality/value: This is the first time internationally to quantitatively assess the impacts of geoengineering on coral reefs. © 2018, 2018 Crown Copyright.","Caribbean Sea; Coral bleaching; Coral growth; Coral recruitment; Hurricanes; Stratospheric aerosol geoengineering","Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Sea; Anthozoa; aerosol; bleaching; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; coral bleaching; coral reef; emission control; hurricane; mitigation; quantitative analysis; stratosphere","M.J.C.

Southern Ocean cloud biases are a major determinant of inter-hemispheric albedo biases in many models, including HadGEM2-ES, a fully coupled model with a dynamical ocean. In this study, targeted albedo corrections are applied in the Southern Ocean to explore the dynamical response to artificially reducing these biases. The Southern Hemisphere jet increases in strength in response to the increased tropical-extratropical temperature gradient, with increased energy transport into the mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, but no improvement is observed in the double-ITCZ bias or atmospheric cross-equatorial energy transport, a finding which supports other recent work. The majority of the adjustment in energy transport in the tropics is achieved in the ocean, with the response further limited to the Pacific Ocean. As a result, the frequently argued teleconnection between the Southern Ocean and tropical precipitation biases is muted. Further experiments in which tropical longwave biases are also reduced do not yield improvement in the representation of the tropical atmosphere. These results suggest that the dramatic improvements in tropical precipitation that have been shown in previous studies may be a function of the lack of dynamical ocean and/or the simplified hemispheric albedo bias corrections applied in that work. It further suggests that efforts to correct the double ITCZ problem in coupled models that focus on large-scale energetic controls will prove fruitless without improvements in the representation of atmospheric processes. © 2016, The Author(s).","Albedo; Climate models; Energy transport; ITCZ; Southern Ocean","Southern Ocean; albedo; climate modeling; intertropical convergence zone; precipitation (climatology); Southern Hemisphere; teleconnection; transport process","M.

RegCM4 is driven by the HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM global models for the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 greenhouse gas and aerosol concentration scenarios. The focus of the analysis is on seasonal and intraseasonal monsoon characteristics. We find two prominent change signals. Over West Africa and the Sahel MPI produces a forward shift in the monsoon season in line with previous findings, and this shift is also simulated by the RegCM4. Furthermore, the regional model produces a widespread decrease of monsoon precipitation (when driven by both MPI and HadGEM) associated with decreased easterly wave activity in the 6–9 days regime and with soil moisture-precipitation interactions. South of the equator we find an extension of the dry season with delayed onset and anticipated recession of the monsoon and a narrowing and strengthening of the ITCZ precipitation band. This signal is consistent in all global and regional model projections, although with different spatial detail.

The investigation is based on the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (MPI-MCMIP5) preindustrial control simulations with the MPI Earth System Model in low resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) supplemented by additional simulations conducted for further analysis. The simulations show a distinct low-frequency component in the global terrestrial carbon content that induces atmospheric CO2 variations on centennial time scales of up to 3 ppm. The main drivers for these variations are low-frequency fluctuations in net primary production (NPP) of the land biosphere. The signal arises from small regions scattered across the whole globe with a pronounced source in North America. The main reason for the global NPP fluctuations is found in climatic changes leading to long-term variations in leaf area index, which largely determines the strength of photosynthetic carbon assimilation. The underlying climatic changes encompass several spatial diverse climatic alterations. For the particular case of North America, the carbon storage changes are (besides NPP) also dependent on soil respiration. This second mechanism is strongly connected to low-frequency variations in incoming shortwave radiation at the surface. ©2013. American Geophysical Union.

Recent petrologic data show that the eruption released very large amounts of climate-relevant sulfur and ozone-destroying chlorine and bromine gases (523±94Mt sulfur, 1200±156Mt chlorine, and 2±0.46Mt bromine). Using the Earth system model (ESM) of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) coupled with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 6 (WACCM6), we simulated the impacts of the sulfur- and halogen-rich Los Chocoyos eruption on the preindustrial Earth system. Our simulations show that elevated sulfate burden and aerosol optical depth (AOD) persists for 5 years in the model, while the volcanic halogens stay elevated for nearly 15 years. As a consequence, the eruption leads to a collapse of the ozone layer with global mean column ozone values dropping to 50DU (80% decrease) and leading to a 550% increase in surface UV over the first 5 years, with potential impacts on the biosphere. The volcanic eruption shows an asymmetric-hemispheric response with enhanced aerosol, ozone, UV, and climate signals over the Northern Hemisphere. Surface climate is impacted globally due to peak AOD of >6, which leads to a maximum surface cooling of >6K, precipitation and terrestrial net primary production decrease of >25%, and sea ice area increases of 40% in the first 3 years. Locally, a wetting (>100%) and strong increase in net primary production (NPP) (>700%) over northern Africa is simulated in the first 5 years and related to a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) to the southern tropics. The ocean responds with pronounced El Niño conditions in the first 3 years that shift to the southern tropics and are coherent with the ITCZ change. Recovery to pre-eruption ozone levels and climate takes 15 years and 30 years, respectively. The long-lasting surface cooling is sustained by an immediate increase in the Arctic sea ice area, followed by a decrease in poleward ocean heat transport at 60°N which lasts up to 20 years. In contrast, when simulating Los Chocoyos conventionally by including sulfur and neglecting halogens, we simulate a larger sulfate burden and AOD, more pronounced surface climate changes, and an increase in column ozone. By comparing our aerosol chemistry ESM results to other supereruption simulations with aerosol climate models, we find a higher surface climate impact per injected sulfur amount than previous studies for our different sets of model experiments, since the CESM2(WACCM6) creates smaller aerosols with a longer lifetime, partly due to the interactive aerosol chemistry. As the model uncertainties for the climate response to supereruptions are very large, observational evidence from paleo archives and a coordinated model intercomparison would help to improve our understanding of the climate and environment response. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Climate change and sea level rise are altering the statistics of these extreme events in a rather complex fashion. Here we use a fully coupled global weather/climate modeling system (GFDL CM4) to study characteristics of extreme daily sea level (ESL) along the U.S. Atlantic coast and their response to global warming. We find that under natural weather processes, the Gulf of Mexico coast is most vulnerable to storm surge and related ESL. New Orleans is a striking hotspot with the highest surge efficiency in response to storm winds. Under a 1% per year atmospheric CO2 increase on centennial time scales, the anthropogenic signal in ESL is robust along the U.S. East Coast. It can emerge from the background variability as soon as in 20 years, or even before global sea level rise is taken into account. The regional dynamic sea level rise induced by the weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation facilitates this early emergence, especially during wintertime coastal flooding associated with nor’easters. Along the Gulf Coast, ESL is sensitive to the modification of hurricane characteristics under the CO2 forcing. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.

Simulation data of Climate Model 2.1 (CM2.1), the Hadley Center Coupled Climate Model 3 (HADCM3), and the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate 3.2 (MIROC3.2), provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), were used as initial and boundary values, and the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B and B1 were selected as the global warming scenarios. The Northwestern Pacific region, which includes Korea, was selected as the study area, and the Yellow Sea, which has a complex coastline, was expressed in detail by increasing the resolution. The average values of the results for the three experiments include a temperature/sea level increase of approximately 3 °C/35 cm from 2000 to 2100 in SRES A1B, and approximately 2 °C /27 cm in SRES B1. The East Sea experienced a larger change owing to the steric effect and showed a larger influence resulting from density changes as the temperature of the Tsushima Warm Current, which passes through the Korea Strait, increased. The result of the study that directly considered the steric effect predicted a higher sea level rise than that of indirect computation because the indirectly computed dynamic height was eliminated; sea level rise in a shallow area cannot be computed, and the unchanged volume serves as undersea pressure. Moreover, the Kuroshio Current, which is a major current in the Northwestern Pacific, showed a decrease in transport as global warming progressed. Despite the differences between models, a decrease of 4-5 SV in transport was observed for 2100; however, there was no notable change in the transport of the Tsushima Warm Current. © APAC 2013.All rights reserved.","Boussinesq approximation; Kuroshio transport; MOM4 model; Sea level rise; Steric; Tsushima Warm Current transport","Coastal engineering; Global warming; Ocean currents; Sea level; Boussinesq approximations; Coupled climate model; Interdisciplinary research; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Kuroshio current; Modular Ocean Model; Oceanic general circulation models; Special report on emissions scenarios; Climate models",""

The CNOP-P approach produces a scenario of climate change within the feasible bounds that could cause maximal uncertainty of NPP. We find that the future NPP will increase due to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2; however, there is a difference in the extent of the variation resulting from the 10 GCMs and the CNOP-P approach. Future NPPs are estimated from 3.89 Gt C (MRI-CGCM3 model) to 4.51 Gt C (bcc-csm1-1 model) using the LPJ model driven by the outputs of 10 GCMs. The estimates of NPP with two CNOP-P-type climate change scenarios are 4.74 Gt C and 5.31 Gt C and are larger than estimates of NPP by the outputs of the 10 GCMs. The above results imply that the terrestrial ecosystem supplies possible conditions for future carbon sinks for all climate change scenarios, especially for the CNOP-P-type climate change scenarios, although the estimates remain uncertain. Stimulative photosynthesis due to high precipitation and restrained autotrophic respiration due to low temperatures may play important roles in the carbon sink due to the CNOP-P-type climate change and CO2 in all climate change scenarios. In addition, it is found that the combination of climate change and increasing CO2 is the main driver of the increase of NPP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycle; Climate change; CNOP-P approach; Net primary production; Prediction","","G.

Four fully coupled simulations were performed: with and without LUCC for two scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Model results show that the global LUCC effects are very small because of offsetting regional signals. Future global land-use emissions due to LUCC in the two scenarios are estimated to be 35.7 and 32.1 Pg C, respectively. The largest regional responses are directly associated with the land cover conversion in the tropics and subtropics. As the albedo effect dominates in mid- and high-latitudes, LUCC produces a small cooling or little effect in the western United States and Eurasia as a result of the reduction in needleleaf evergreen trees. LUCC increases temperature by 0.05-0.1°C in the tropics due to the reduction in evapotranspiration because of the conversion from rainforests to croplands. When compared with greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosol influences, LUCC has a second-order effect on the temperature change at the global scale. However, for the CO2 fluxes, the LUCC and GHG/aerosol effects are equally important and the former is much stronger than the latter over some regions such as Africa and South and North America. The land-atmosphere CO2 flux can be regionally modulated by LUCC when compared with the effects of GHG/aerosol forcings. Although there is no significant land cover change in higher latitudes, climate responses to LUCC occur over boreal and arctic regions, indicating that atmospheric teleconnection can modify regional climate far away from the areas with LUCC. These results highlight the need to understand the responses of carbon cycle and remote climate to LUCC over longer time scales. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.","Climatic impact; Future climate projection; Land use and land cover change","Africa; Eurasia; South America; United States; Beams and girders; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Tropics; Climatic impact; Future climate projections; Land use and land cover change; Land-cover change; Regional response; Second order effect; Temperature changes; Western United States; atmospheric forcing; carbon cycle; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; evapotranspiration; land cover; land use change; teleconnection; Climate models",""

This model is based on the physical core of the CNRM climate model version 5 (CNRM-CM5) model and employs the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) and the Pelagic Interaction Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies (PISCES) as terrestrial and oceanic components of the global carbon cycle. We describe a preindustrial and 20th century climate simulation following the CMIP5 protocol. We detail how the various carbon reservoirs were initialized and analyze the behavior of the carbon cycle and its prominent physical drivers. Over the 1986-2005 period, CNRM-ESM1 reproduces satisfactorily several aspects of the modern carbon cycle. On land, the model captures the carbon cycling through vegetation and soil, resulting in a net terrestrial carbon sink of 2.2 Pg C year-1. In the ocean, the large-scale distribution of hydrodynamical and biogeochemical tracers agrees with a modern climatology from the World Ocean Atlas. The combination of biological and physical processes induces a net CO2 uptake of 1.7 Pg C year-1 that falls within the range of recent estimates. Our analysis shows that the atmospheric climate of CNRM-ESM1 compares well with that of CNRM-CM5. Biases in precipitation and shortwave radiation over the tropics generate errors in gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration. Compared to CNRM-CM5, the revised ocean-sea ice coupling has modified the sea-ice cover and ocean ventilation, unrealistically strengthening the flow of North Atlantic deep water (26.1 ± 2 Sv). It results in an accumulation of anthropogenic carbon in the deep ocean. © 2016 Author(s).","","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); anthropogenic effect; atlas; atmosphere-ice-ocean system; carbon cycle; carbon sink; climate modeling; ecosystem function; global change; North Atlantic Deep Water; primary production; shortwave radiation; soil respiration; twentieth century","R.

The rainfall rate that delivers the most accumulated rain (i.e., amount mode) is systematically too weak in all versions of CAM relative to TRMM 3B42 and does not improve with horizontal resolution. It is improved by superparameterization though, with higher modes in regions of tropical wave, Madden-Julian Oscillation, and monsoon activity. Superparameterization produces better representations of extreme rates compared to TRMM 3B42, without sensitivity to horizontal resolution seen in CAM. SPCAM produces more dry days over land and fewer over the ocean. Updates to CAM's low cloud parameterizations have narrowed the frequency peak of light rain, converging toward SPCAM. Poleward of 50°, where more rainfall is produced by resolved-scale processes in CAM, few differences discriminate the rainfall properties of the two models. These results are discussed in light of their implication for future rainfall changes in response to climate forcing. © 2016.

We use a coupled climate model that allows us to integrate over climate noise and assess underlying mechanisms. We use an ensemble of ten 300-yr-long simulations forced by a 50-yr oscillatory North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)-derived surface heat flux anomaly in the North Atlantic, and a 4000-yr-long preindustrial control simulation performed with GFDL CM2.1. In both setups, an AMV phase change induced by a change in the AMOC's cross-equatorial heat transport forces an atmospheric interhemispheric energy imbalance that is compensated by a change in the cross-equatorial atmospheric heat transport due to a meridional ITCZ shift. Such linkages occur on decadal time scales in the ensemble driven by the imposed forcing, and internally on multicentennial time scales in the control. Regional precipitation anomalies differ between the ensemble and the control for a zonally averaged ITCZ shift of similar magnitude, which suggests a dependence on time scale. Our study supports observational evidence of an AMV-ITCZ link in the twentieth century and further links it to the AMOC, whose long-time-scale variability can influence the phasing of ITCZ migrations. In contrast to the AMV, our calculations suggest that the PDO does not drive ITCZ migrations, because the PDO does not modulate the interhemispheric energy balance. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.

This model embeds a terrestrial biogeochemical component with explicit carbon-nitrogen interaction to account for soil nutrient control on plant growth and the land carbon sink. The model's ocean biogeochemical component is largely updated to simulate the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and oxygen such that oceanic primary productivity can be controlled by multiple nutrient limitations. The ocean nitrogen cycle is coupled with the land component via river discharge processes, and external inputs of iron from pyrogenic and lithogenic sources are considered. Comparison of a historical simulation with observation studies showed that the model could reproduce the transient global climate change and carbon cycle as well as the observed large-scale spatial patterns of the land carbon cycle and upper-ocean biogeochemistry. The model demonstrated historical human perturbation of the nitrogen cycle through land use and agriculture and simulated the resultant impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Sensitivity analyses under preindustrial conditions revealed that the simulated ocean biogeochemistry could be altered regionally (and substantially) by nutrient input from the atmosphere and rivers. Based on an idealized experiment in which CO2 was prescribed to increase at a rate of 1%yr-1, the transient climate response (TCR) is estimated to be 1.5 K, i.e., approximately 70% of that from our previous ESM used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The cumulative airborne fraction (AF) is also reduced by 15% because of the intensified land carbon sink, which results in an airborne fraction close to the multimodel mean of the CMIP5 ESMs. The transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) is 1.3KEgC-1, i.e., slightly smaller than the average of the CMIP5 ESMs, which suggests that ""optimistic"" future climate projections will be made by the model. This model and the simulation results contribute to CMIP6. The MIROC-ES2L could further improve our understanding of climate-biogeochemical interaction mechanisms, projections of future environmental changes, and exploration of our future options regarding sustainable development by evolving the processes of climate, biogeochemistry, and human activities in a holistic and interactive manner. © Author(s)2020.","","biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; climate modeling; CMIP; comparative study; feedback mechanism; global climate; human activity; land use change; marine ecosystem; nitrogen cycle","T.

The results demonstrate that the double ITCZ bias still exists in the two coupled models, both of which simulate a spurious rain belt in the south of the equator. The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and surface wind also appear distinctly different to the observations, particularly in FGOALS-g2, corresponding to the anomalous distribution of precipitation. Feedback analysis in the south-central equatorial Pacific shows that the shortwave radiation and SST feedbacks are significantly weaker on both models than in the observations. This is one of the factors contributing to the double ITCZ bias. The two models share the same oceanic component, while their simulated general atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns are considerably different. Comparison with the results of the AMIP run demonstrates that the bias in coupled models results primarily from the atmospheric component. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","CMIP5; Double ITCZ; FGOALS-g2; FGOALS-s2; South-central equatorial Pacific","","H.

Here we report on PlioMIP2 simulations carried out by the two versions of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM), NorESM-L and NorESM1-F, with updated boundary conditions derived from the Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping version 4 (PRISM4). NorESM1-M is the version of NorESM that contributed to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). NorESM-L is the lowresolution of NorESM1-M, whereas NorESM1-F is a computationally efficient version of NorESM1-M, with similar resolutions and updated physics. Relative to NorESM1-M, there are notable improvements in simulating the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and the distribution of sea ice in NorESM1-F, partly due to the updated ocean physics. The two NorESM versions both produce warmer and wetter Pliocene climate, with a greater warming over land than over ocean. Relative to the preindustrial period, the simulated Pliocene global mean surface air temperature is 2.1 °C higher with NorESM-L and 1.7 °C higher with NorESM1-F, and the corresponding global mean sea surface temperature enhances by 1.5 and 1.2 °C. The simulated precipitation for the Pliocene increases by 0.14mmd 1 globally in both model versions, with large increases in the tropics and especially in the monsoon regions and only minor changes, or even slight decreases, in subtropical regions. The intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) shifts northward in the Atlantic and Africa in boreal summer. In the simulated warmer and wetter Pliocene world, AMOC becomes deeper and stronger, with the maximum AMOC levels increasing by ∼ 9% (with NorESM-L) and ∼ 15% (with NorESM1-F), while the meridional overturning circulation slightly strengthens in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Although the two models produce similar Pliocene climates, they also generate some differences, in particular for the Southern Ocean and the northern middle and high latitudes, which should be investigated through PlioMIP2 in the future. As compared to PlioMIP1, the simulated Pliocene warming with NorESM-L is weaker in PlioMIP2 but otherwise shows very similar responses. © Author(s) 2020.","","Africa; Atlantic Ocean; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Southern Ocean; air temperature; boundary condition; CMIP; computer simulation; intertropical convergence zone; meridional circulation; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; Pliocene; sea surface temperature","Z.

One goal was to check how realistically representative marine biogeochemical tracer distributions could be reproduced by models. In routine assessments model historical hindcasts were compared with available modern biogeochemical observations. However, these assessments considered neither how close modeled biogeochemical reservoirs were to equilibrium nor the sensitivity of model performance to initial conditions or to the spin-up protocols. Here, we explore how the large diversity in spin-up protocols used for marine biogeochemistry in CMIP5 Earth system models (ESMs) contributes to model-to-model differences in the simulated fields. We take advantage of a 500-year spin-up simulation of IPSL-CM5A-LR to quantify the influence of the spin-up protocol on model ability to reproduce relevant data fields. Amplification of biases in selected biogeochemical fields (O2, NO3, Alk-DIC) is assessed as a function of spin-up duration. We demonstrate that a relationship between spin-up duration and assessment metrics emerges from our model results and holds when confronted with a larger ensemble of CMIP5 models. This shows that drift has implications for performance assessment in addition to possibly aliasing estimates of climate change impact. Our study suggests that differences in spin-up protocols could explain a substantial part of model disparities, constituting a source of model-to-model uncertainty.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain mechanisms of this CO2 growth based on either ocean or land carbon sources. Here, we apply the Earth system model MPI-ESM-LR for two transient simulations of climate and carbon cycle dynamics during this period. In the first simulation, atmospheric CO2 is prescribed following ice-core CO2 data. In response to the growing atmospheric CO2 concentration, land carbon storage increases until 2000BCE, stagnates afterwards, and decreases from 1CE, while the ocean continuously takes CO2 out of the atmosphere after 4000BCE. This leads to a missing source of 166Pg of carbon in the ocean-land-atmosphere system by the end of the simulation. In the second experiment, we applied a CO2 nudging technique using surface alkalinity forcing to follow the reconstructed CO2 concentration while keeping the carbon cycle interactive. In that case the ocean is a source of CO2 from 6000 to 2000BCE due to a decrease in the surface ocean alkalinity. In the prescribed CO2 simulation, surface alkalinity declines as well. However, it is not sufficient to turn the ocean into a CO2 source. The carbonate ion concentration in the deep Atlantic decreases in both the prescribed and the interactive CO2 simulations, while the magnitude of the decrease in the prescribed CO2 experiment is underestimated in comparison with available proxies. As the land serves as a carbon sink until 2000BCE due to natural carbon cycle processes in both experiments, the missing source of carbon for land and atmosphere can only be attributed to the ocean. Within our model framework, an additional mechanism, such as surface alkalinity decrease, for example due to unaccounted for carbonate accumulation processes on shelves, is required for consistency with ice-core CO2 data. Consequently, our simulations support the hypothesis that the ocean was a source of CO2 until the late Holocene when anthropogenic CO2 sources started to affect atmospheric CO2. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

A simple marine ecosystem model with coupled equations representing the marine carbon cycle, it formed the ocean biogeochemistry sub-model in the Met Office's HadGEM2-ES Earth system model. The equations are presented and described in full, along with the underlying assumptions, and particular attention is given to how they were implemented for the CMIP5 simulations. Results from the CMIP5 historical simulation (particularly those for the simulated 1990s) are shown and compared to data: dissolved nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon, as well as biological components, productivity and fluxes. Where possible, the amplitude and phase of the predicted seasonal cycle are evaluated. Since the model was developed to explore and predict the effects of climate change on the marine ecosystem and marine carbon cycle, the response of the model to the RCP8.5 future scenario is also shown. While the model simulates the historical and current global annual mean air-sea <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> flux well and is consistent with other modelling studies about how that flux will change under future scenarios, several of the ecosystem metrics are less well simulated. The total chlorophyll is higher than observations, while the primary productivity is just below the estimated range. In the CMIP5 simulations certain parameter choices meant that the diatoms and the misc-phytoplankton state variables behave more similarly than they should, and the surface dissolved silicate concentration drifts to excessively high levels. The main structural problem with the model is shown to be the iron sub-model. © Author(s) 2019.","","Bacillariophyta; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; dissolved inorganic carbon; marine ecosystem; marine environment; simulation","I.J.

The results demonstrate that both models simulate two individual zones of intra-seasonal variance in both hemispheres to varying degrees, perhaps owing to the double ITCZ model bias. In particular, the primary difference between the models and observations is that the maximum variance occurs over the western Indian Ocean in the models rather than the eastern Indian Ocean compared with the observations. However, both models replicate the broad features of the observed climate, particularly the power maximum at a period of 60 days and latitude of 10°S, although FGOALS-s2 appears to simulate somewhat standing oscillations. Both models fail to produce the main period of intra-seasonal precipitation, and the power spectra over the Indian Ocean are concentrated at lower frequencies (more than 90 days) than those over the western Pacific (less than 30 days).

The investigation of future climate impacts at the coast thus requires sufficiently detailed projections for the offshore waves and sea levels in both the present day and under future climate scenarios, to provide boundary conditions for detailed coastal impact models. The process of model downscaling, in a climate modelling sense, is generally taken to refer to the generation of locally relevant data from the output of global circulation models of the atmosphere and ocean. The aim is to connect global-scale projections and regional dynamics to generate regionally specific projections relevant to coastal management decision-making. We discuss research conducted as part of Phase 2 of the Tyndall Coastal Simulator research project on the future changes in surge and wave climate forced by winds and sea-level atmospheric pressures from a version of the Met Office Hadley Centre Climate Model (HadCM3), assuming various greenhouse gas emission scenarios and for various climate model parameter choices. The local spatial variation in mean sea level is also taken into account, incorporating deviations from global mean sea-level caused by regional variations in ocean density and circulation. The UK is still subject to glacial isostatic adjustment after the last ice age, counteracting recent sea-level rise. Dynamical downscaling from a global coupled atmosphere–ocean model, using a regional climate model, has been used to provide more realistic and detailed simulations of wind and pressure over the NW European continental shelf. These were then used to drive storm surge and wave models. This study was used in the Tyndall Coastal Simulator to understand the effects of different uncertainties in the climate system, in terms of marine parameters for the north Norfolk coast. Hence, the dominant drivers could be identified for analysis in later chapters. The changes in wave and surge conditions were less than suggested by earlier analyses, and the wave and surge conditions were assumed to be unchanged compared to today (Appendix A). These results were also used directly in UKCP09 (Lowe et al, UK Climate Projections science report: marine and coastal projections. Met Office Hadley Centre, Exeter, 2009). In the future, larger ensembles of wave simulations would provide a better description of future conditions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Downscaling; Modelling; Sea level; Storm surge; Waves","","J.

However, the effects of meltwater from the ice sheets and ice shelves of Antarctica are not included in the widely used CMIP5 climate models, which introduces bias into IPCC climate projections. Here we assess a large ensemble simulation of the CMIP5 model ‘GFDL ESM2M’ that accounts for RCP8.5-projected Antarctic Ice Sheet meltwater. We find that, relative to the standard RCP8.5 scenario, accounting for meltwater delays the exceedance of the maximum global-mean atmospheric warming targets of 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius by more than a decade, enhances drying of the Southern Hemisphere and reduces drying of the Northern Hemisphere, increases the formation of Antarctic sea ice (consistent with recent observations of increasing Antarctic sea-ice area) and warms the subsurface ocean around the Antarctic coast. Moreover, the meltwater-induced subsurface ocean warming could lead to further ice-sheet and ice-shelf melting through a positive feedback mechanism, highlighting the importance of including meltwater effects in simulations of future climate. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","","Air; Antarctic Regions; Atmosphere; Freezing; Global Warming; Hot Temperature; Ice Cover; Oceans and Seas; Rain; Seawater; Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctica; air; rain; sea water; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; feedback mechanism; future prospect; greenhouse gas; ice sheet; ice shelf; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; meltwater; Northern Hemisphere; sea ice; Southern Hemisphere; Antarctica; article; climate; ice sheet; ice shelf; melting point; Northern Hemisphere; positive feedback; sea ice; seashore; simulation; Southern Hemisphere; warming; Antarctica; atmosphere; chemistry; freezing; greenhouse effect; heat; ice cover; sea; statistics and numerical data","B.

Two recent versions are described: BCC_CSM1.1 with coarse resolution (approximately 2.8125°×2.8125°) and BCC_CSM1.1(m) with moderate resolution (approximately 1.125°×1.125°). Both versions are fully coupled climate-carbon cycle models that simulate the global terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycles and include dynamic vegetation. Both models well simulate the concentration and temporal evolution of atmospheric CO2 during the 20th century with anthropogenic CO2 emissions prescribed. Simulations using these two versions of the BCC_CSM model have been contributed to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase five (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). These simulations are available for use by both national and international communities for investigating global climate change and for future climate projections. Simulations of the 20th century climate using BCC_CSM1.1 and BCC_CSM1.1(m) are presented and validated, with particular focus on the spatial pattern and seasonal evolution of precipitation and surface air temperature on global and continental scales. Simulations of climate during the last millennium and projections of climate change during the next century are also presented and discussed. Both BCC_CSM1.1 and BCC_CSM1.1(m) perform well when compared with other CMIP5 models.

Modern assemblages from the worldwide dinocyst atlas (Zonneveld et al., 2013) were added to provide a better geographical coverage of the South Atlantic Ocean. The environmental dataset was updated using the World Ocean Atlas 2013 for sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-surface salinity (SSS) data, as well as for 1997–2017 mean NPP values recorded during SeaWifs and MODIS spatial programs. New environmental datasets were tested using anomalies regarding mean latitudinal SST as a potential index to track past upwelling activity. Finally, preindustrial NPP values, simulated with the IPSL-CM5A-LR model developed at the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) have been added to the dinocyst environmental database to provide NPP values consistent with the mean age of “modern” dinocyst assemblages. The transfer function method using the updated modern database was then applied to fossil dinocyst assemblages of core KZAI-01, retrieved off the Congo River mouth and covering the last 43.2 kyr. Our results indicate a dominant orbital forcing, with higher primary productivity values reconstructed during precession minima (MIS 3 and the last deglaciation) and enhanced by a maximum of obliquity during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. The synchronicity between high upwelling intensity and high terrigenous inputs during high NPP period (e.g. during the last Deglaciation) highlighted the prevalent role of river-induced upwelling activity, which is specific to the Congo River. These results have improved our understanding of the environmental forcing leading to major trophic changes in the intertropical area. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycle; Orbital forcing; Transfer function; West Equatorial Africa","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (East); Atlantic Ocean (South); Atlantic Ocean (Tropical); Congo River; Dinophyceae; atlas; carbon cycle; database; dinoflagellate cyst; fossil assemblage; fossil record; Holocene; last deglaciation; MODIS; net primary production; obliquity; orbital forcing; quantitative analysis; sea surface salinity; sea surface temperature; transfer function; upwelling","W.

It is shown that internal THC variability in the coupled climate system is concentrated at interannual and centennial time scales, with the centennial mode being dominant. Centennial oscillations of the THC can impact surface climate via an interhemispheric SST contrast of 0.1°C in the Tropics and more than 0.5°C in mid- and high latitudes. A mechanism is proposed based on detailed process analysis involving large-scale air-sea interaction on multidecadal time scales. Anomalous northward ocean heat transport associated with a strong phase of the Atlantic THC generates a cross-equatorial SST gradient. This causes the ITCZ to move to a more northerly position with increased strength. The extra rainfall resulting from the anomalous ITCZ imposes a freshwater flux and produces a salinity anomaly in the tropical North Atlantic. Such sustained salinity anomalies slowly propagate toward the subpolar North Atlantic at a lag of 5-6 decades. The accumulated low-salinity water lowers upper-ocean density, which causes the THC to slow down. The oscillation then enters the opposite phase.","","Atlantic Ocean; oceanic regions; World; Climatology; Computer simulation; Oceanography; Oscillations; Water; anomaly; atmosphere-ocean coupling; freshwater input; heat transfer; intertropical convergence zone; salinity; sea surface temperature; temporal variation; thermohaline circulation; Centennial variability; Freshwater; Sea surface temperature (SST); Thermohaline circulation (THC); Climate change","M.

HadCM3 is a newly developed model which does not require flux adjustment to maintain a stable climatology. Global-average sea-level rise from 1990 to 2100 is predicted to be 0.48 m in HadCM2 and 0.44 m in HadCM3, 60% resulting from thermal expansion of sea-water and the rest from loss of mass of glaciers and small ice-caps. Sea-level rise is smaller in HadCM3 principally because the radiative forcing is slightly less, giving reduced ocean heat uptake and thermal expansion. However, the heat penetrates less deeply in HadCM3; consequently the surface warming is nearly the same. There is marked geographical variation of sea-level change, which is generally similar in the two models; local values range between zero and twice the global average.","","Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Earth atmosphere; Glaciers; Ice; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric turbulence; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Seawater; Thermal expansion; Coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation model; Developed model; Flux adjustments; Geographical variations; Glaciers and small ice caps; Ocean heat uptake; Radiative forcings; Regional sea level changes; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate change; general circulation model; sea level change; Atmosphere-ocean general circulation models; Ice caps; Sea level rise; Climate change; Sea level","J.M.

In soft cliff environments, coastal retreat may occur at rapid rates. The environmental significance of soft cliff environments, coupled with the societal impacts of cliff retreat, means that it is important to understand the processes and timings of soft cliff erosion. Here, a new statistical, process-response model of soft cliff erosion is proposed, based on the premise that wave energy delivered to the cliff toe is the key parameter forcing erosion. More specifically, and in contrast to prior studies that have sought to link erosion rates to indices of peak wave energy, we postulate that the Accumulated Excess wave Energy (AEE; the time integrated total wave energy above an erosion threshold), is the key hydraulic control on soft cliff erosion. The new model is calibrated to two UK sites with contrasting (Atlantic versus North Sea) wave energy regimes, before downscaled HadCM3 Global Climate Model outputs are used to assess how future (next ~100year) changes in sea-level and wave height affect retreat rates at the two study sites. We show that the AEE model accounts for between 46% and 89% of the variance in observed coastal erosion; representing an improvement over prior models that use measures only of peak wave energy. The AEE model suggests increases of between 0.5m.a-1 (92%) and 0.3m.a-1 (33%) in mean erosion rate by 2100 for sites in the Atlantic and North Sea, respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that at both sites extreme events, exceeding the 95th percentile value, are projected to become three to four times more likely under scenarios of future climate change, highlighting a need to understand and predict the extreme response of coastal cliff systems to changes in climate. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Coastal erosion; Sea-level rise; Soft cliffs; Statistical process-response model; Wave energy","Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; United Kingdom; cliff; climate change; climate effect; coastal erosion; modeling; sea level change; statistical analysis; wave energy; wave height","C.

Fully coupled and ocean-ice configurations are examined; both capture many aspects of the spatial structure and seasonality of surface carbon fields. Nearly ubiquitous negative biases in surface alkalinity result from the prescribed carbonate dissolution profile. The modeled sea-air CO2 fluxes match observationally based estimates over much of the ocean; significant deviations appear in the Southern Ocean. Surface ocean pCO2 is biased high in the subantarctic and low in the sea ice zone. Formation of the water masses dominating anthropogenic CO2 (Cant) uptake in the Southern Hemisphere is weak in the model, leading to significant negative biases in Cant and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) storage at intermediate depths. Column inventories of Cant appear too high, by contrast, in the North Atlantic. In spite of the positive bias, this marks an improvement over prior versions of the model, which underestimated North Atlantic uptake. The change in behavior is attributable to a new parameterization of density-driven overflows. CESM1(BGC) provides a relatively robust representation of the ocean-carbon cycle response to climate variability. Statistical metrics of modeled interannual variability in sea-air CO2 fluxes compare reasonably well to observationally based estimates. The carbon cycle response to key modes of climate variability is basically similar in the coupled and forced ocean-ice models; however, the two differ in regional detail and in the strength of teleconnections. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.","","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Southern Ocean; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Oceanography; Sea ice; Carbon storage; Carbon uptake; Climate variability; Earth system modeling; Fully-coupled; Negative bias; North Atlantic; Oceanic carbon uptake; Spatial structure; Twentieth century; air-sea interaction; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; teleconnection; twentieth century; Earth system models","M.C.

Modeling studies show that the ITCZ structure is very sensitive to moist convection parameterization and in particular, to the vertical profile of convective heating and freetropospheric moistening. To further explore this sensitivity, the authors focus in this study on the influence of lateral entrainment in convective plumes on the simulated tropical precipitation and large-scale circulation. Sensitivity studies to the entrainment parameter were performed in a hierarchy of models (coupled ocean- atmosphere GCM, atmospheric GCM, and aquaplanet GCM), in order to mitigate the double ITCZ problem in the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques Coupled Global Climate Model, version 5 (CNRMCM5). The sensitivity of the ITCZ structure to lateral entrainment is robust across our hierarchy of models. In response to increased entrainment, the realistic simulations exhibit a weakening of the southern side of the double ITCZ over the southeastern Pacific Ocean and a better representation of the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ). However, as a result of stronger moisture-convection feedbacks, precipitation is overestimated in the center of convergence zones. The change in ITCZ configuration is associated with a more realistic representation of the large-scale vertical regimes, explained by a decreased frequency of weak-tomoderate ascending regimes and an enhanced frequency of subsidence regimes. Mechanisms at play in this circulation change are examined by analyzing the vertically integrated dry static energy budget. This energetic analysis suggests that the feedback between large-scale dynamics and deep convection is crucial in controlling the probability distribution function (PDF) of midtropospheric vertical wind. This PDF, in turn, controls the precipitation distribution and, in particular, the double ITCZ bias. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.","","Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Southeast); Climate models; Distribution functions; Probability distributions; Coupled general circulation models; Coupled global climate model; Intertropical convergence zone; Large-scale circulation; Moisture-convection feedback; Precipitation distribution; South pacific convergence zones; Tropical precipitation; atmospheric moisture; atmospheric plume; climate feedback; climate modeling; convective system; entrainment; general circulation model; intertropical convergence zone; precipitation (climatology); vertical profile; Lasers","B.

One method of investigating the behaviour of the Greenland and the Antarctic ice sheets in a warmer-than-modern climate is to look back at past warm periods of Earth history, for example the Pliocene. This paper presents climate and ice sheet modelling results for the mid-Pliocene warm period (mPWP; 3.3 to 3.0. million years ago), which has been identified as a key interval for understanding warmer-than-modern climates (Jansen et al., 2007). Using boundary conditions supplied by the United States Geological Survey PRISM Group (Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping), the Hadley Centre coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model (HadCM3) and the British Antarctic Survey Ice Sheet Model (BASISM), we show large reductions in the Greenland and East Antarctic Ice Sheets (GrIS and EAIS) compared to modern in standard mPWP experiments. We also present the first results illustrating the variability of the ice sheets due to realistic orbital forcing during the mid-Pliocene. While GrIS volumes are lower than modern under even the most extreme (cold) mid-Pliocene orbit (losing at least 35% of its ice mass), the EAIS can both grow and shrink, losing up to 20% or gaining up to 10% of its present-day volume. The changes in ice sheet volume incurred by altering orbital forcing alone means that global sea level can vary by more than 25. m during the mid-Pliocene. However, we have also shown that the response of the ice sheets to mPWP orbital hemispheric forcing can be in anti-phase, whereby the greatest reductions in EAIS volume are concurrent with the smallest reductions of the GrIS. If this anti-phase relationship is in operation throughout the mPWP, then the total eustatic sea level response would be dampened compared to the ice sheet fluctuations that are theoretically possible. This suggests that maximum eustatic sea level rise does not correspond to orbital maxima, but occurs at times where the anti-phasing of Northern and Southern Hemisphere ice sheet retreat is minimised. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Ice sheets; Orbital forcing; Pliocene; Sea level","Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate modeling; eustacy; geological survey; ice sheet; Northern Hemisphere; orbital forcing; paleoclimate; Pliocene; sensitivity analysis; Southern Hemisphere; uncertainty role","A.M.

The authors report on tropical forest projections from the new Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 2 Earth System configuration (HadGEM2-ES) and compare them to results from the previous generation model [third climate configuration of the Met Office Unified Model in lower resolution with carbon cycle (HadCM3LC)], which had projected near-complete dieback of the Amazon rain forest for a business as usual scenario. In contrast, HadGEM2-ES projects minimal change in Amazon forest extent. The main aim of this study is a preliminary investigation of this difference between the two models. It is found that around 40% of thedifference in forest dieback projections is associated with differences in the projected change in dry-season length. Differences in control climatologies of temperature and dry-season length, projected regional warming, and the forest response to climate and CO2 also all contribute to the increased survival of forest in HadGEM2-ES. However, HadGEM2-ES does not invalidate HadCM3LC: Amazon dieback remains a possible scenario of dangerous change that requires further understanding.

We start with the early experiments on Amazon deforestation in the late 1970s, and the evolution of these experiments to the latest studies on greenhouse gases emission scenarios and land use changes until the end of the twenty-first century. The ""Amazon dieback"" simulated by the HadCM3 model occurs after a ""tipping point"" of CO2 concentration and warming. Experiments on Amazon deforestation and change of climate suggest that once a critical deforestation threshold (or tipping point) of 40-50% forest loss is reached in eastern Amazonia, climate would change in a way which is dangerous for the remaining forest. This may favor a collapse of the tropical forest, with a substitution of the forest by savanna-type vegetation. The concept of ""dangerous climate change,"" as a climate change, which induces positive feedback, which accelerate the change, is strongly linked to the occurrence of tipping points, and it can be explained as the presence of feedback between climate change and the carbon cycle, particularly involving a weakening of the current terrestrial carbon sink and a possible reversal from a sink (as in present climate) to a source by the year 2050. We must, therefore, currently consider the drying simulated by the Hadley Centre model(s) as having a finite probability under global warming, with a potentially enormous impact, but with some degree of uncertainty. © Copyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.","","",""

The suppression is induced by a strong initial perturbation to the salinity distribution in the upper layer of the northern North Atlantic. The model is then allowed to adjust freely. Salinity gradually increases and deep water formation in the Greenland and Norwegian Seas restarts, later also in the Labrador Sea. The meridional overturning recovers after about 120 yr. In the first few decades when the overturning is very weak surface air temperature is dominated by cooling of much of the Northern Hemisphere and weak warming of the Southern Hemisphere, leading to maximum global cooling of 0.9°C. The disruption to the atmosphere's radiation balance results in a downward flux anomaly at the top of the atmosphere, maximally 0.55 W m-2 in the first decade then decreasing with the THC recovery. The processes responsible for the recovery of the THC is examined in detail. In future model development this will help to reduce uncertainty in modeling THC stability. The recovery is driven by coupled ocean-atmosphere response. Northward salt transport by the subtropical gyre is crucial to the recovery of salinity in the North Atlantic. A southward shift of the ITCZ creates positive salinity anomalies in the tropical North Atlantic. This supports the northward salt transport by the subtropical gyre that helps to restart deep water formation and the THC.","","(North); Atlantic Ocean; Atmospheric temperature; Cooling; Radiation effects; Salinity measurement; Thermohaline circulations; air temperature; air-sea interaction; deep water formation; radiation balance; salinity; thermohaline circulation; Climatology","M.

Organic carbon in cropland soils is an active pool which is strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities. SOC in cropland soils accounted for 14.5% of the total organic carbon stock of 89.61. Mt C in China. In this study, RothC model was used to simulate the change of SOC in upland soils at 626 original 50. km × 50. km grids under B2 and A2 climate scenarios during the upcoming decades in China. Future climate data under B2 and A2 scenarios were predicted by Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies (PRECIS) regional climate model downscaled based on HadCM3. The simulation results showed that SOC will generally decrease during the next decades and the decrease rate of SOC will be higher over time if there is no addition of organic material (e.g. organic manure application or straw return) adopted in China. Simulations got the following results: (i) SOC will decrease in most areas of China, especially in northern China; the increase of SOC only occurred in a few scattered grids in Southwest China and mid-south China. The decrease rate of SOC in northern China was higher than in southern China under either B2 or A2 climate scenarios. (ii) The changing rate of SOC over time under B2 scenario was minor during the early 21st century and quite large during the late 21st century. In contrast, the changing rate of SOC over time under A2 scenario was somewhat constant over time. The percentage decrease (decrease rate divided by its basic value in 1980s) of SOC in northern China was around 5.5%, 12%, and 15% by the year 2020, 2050, and 2080 under B2 and A2 scenarios, while it was about 2.3%, 7.7%, and 10.9% under B2 scenario and 3.3%, 4.5%, and 5.5% under A2 scenario in southern China. (iii) Upland soils would lose organic carbon by 2.7. t. C/ha, 6.0. t. C/ha, and 7.8. t. C/ha at the 0-30. cm depth by the year 2020, 2050, and 2080, respectively, under the typical conventional tillage without organic material amendment under B2 scenario in China, which accounted for about 4.2%, 9.3%, and 12.1%, respectively, of the basic SOC of 1980s in the upland soils. SOC would decrease by 2.9. t. C/ha, 6.8. t. C/ha, and 8.2. t. C/ha by the year 2020, 2050, and 2080, respectively, under A2 scenario in China, which accounted for about 4.5%, 10.5%, and 12.7%, respectively, of that in 1980s under the conventional tillage and management practices. (iv) Our simulations of future change in SOC suggest it is the influence of combination by temperature, precipitation, evaporation, and original soil properties together and that the predominant factors and the interaction among these factors will vary in different geographical regions. The limitations and uncertainties of the simulation are also discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon stock; Climate change; Cropland soil; Regional modeling; Soil organic carbon; Upland soil","China; agricultural land; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; human activity; soil carbon; soil organic matter; twenty first century; upland region","L.

Alternative representations of global vegetation cover from observations and a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) were used as the landcover component for a number of HadCM3 experiments under a nominal present day climate state, and compared to the simulations using the standard land cover map of HadCM3. The alternative vegetation covers result in a large scale cooling of the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics relative to the HadCM3 standard, resulting in a southward shift in the location of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). A significant reduction in Indian monsoon precipitation is also found, which is related to a weakening of the South Asian monsoon circulation, broadly consistent with documented mechanisms relating to temperature and snow perturbations in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics in winter and spring, delaying the onset of the monsoon. The role of the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics on tropical climate is demonstrated, with an additional representation of vegetation cover based on DGVM simulated changes in Northern Hemisphere vegetation from the end of the 21st Century. This experiment shows that through similar processes the simulated extra-tropical vegetation changes in the future contribute to a strengthening of the South Asian monsoon in this model. These findings provide renewed motivation to give careful consideration to the role of global scale vegetation feedbacks when looking at climate change, and its impact on the tropical circulation and South Asian monsoon in the latest generation of Earth System models. © Author(s) 2012.","","South Asia; South Asia; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Climate models; Computer simulation; Experiments; Vegetation; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Climate models; Earth system models; Tropics; Asian monsoon; Convergence zones; Earth system model; Global scale; Indian monsoon; Land cover; Northern Hemispheres; Tropical climates; Vegetation change; Vegetation cover; Vegetation feedbacks; Vegetation model; Asian monsoon; Climate state; Convergence zones; Influence of vegetations; Land cover; Land cover maps; Large-scales; Northern Hemispheres; Vegetation cover; Vegetation model; air temperature; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate modeling; Hadley cell; intertropical convergence zone; monsoon; Northern Hemisphere; precipitation (climatology); snow; tropical environment; vegetation cover; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate modeling; extratropical environment; intertropical convergence zone; monsoon; Northern Hemisphere; precipitation (climatology); tropical environment; vegetation cover; Tropics; Vegetation","M.P.

The influence of increased CO2 and changing climate on the carbon cycle of the terrestrial ecosystems in China is still unclear. In this article we used a process-based ecosystem model, Biome-BGC, to assess the effects of changing climate and elevated atmospheric CO2 on terrestrial China's carbon cycle during two time periods: (1) the present (1961-2000) and (2) a future with projected climate change under doubled CO2 (2071-2110). The effects of climate change alone were estimated by driving Biome-BGC with a fixed CO2 concentration and changing climate, while the CO2 fertilization effects were calculated as the difference between the results driven by both increasing CO2 and changing climate and those of variable climate alone. Model simulations indicate that during 1961-2000 at the national scale, changes in climate reduced carbon storage in China's ecosystems, but increasing CO2 compensated for these adverse effects of climate change, resulting in an overall increase in the carbon storage of China's ecosystems despite decreases in soil carbon. The interannual variability of the carbon cycle was associated with climate variations. Regional differences in climate change produced differing regional carbon uptake responses. Spatially, reductions in carbon in vegetation and soils and increases in litter carbon were primarily caused by climate change in most parts of east China, while carbon in vegetation, soils, and litter increased for much of west China. Under the future scenario (2071-2110), with a doubling CO2, China will experience higher precipitation and temperature as predicted by the Hadley Centre HadCM3 for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment. The concomitant doubling of CO2 will continue to counteract the negative effects of climate change on carbon uptake in the future, leading to an increase in carbon storage relative to current levels. This study highlights the role of CO2 fertilization in the carbon budget of China's ecosystems, although future studies should include other important processes such as land use change, human management (e.g., fertilization and irrigation), environmental pollution, etc. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.","","Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; annual variation; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; soil carbon; terrestrial ecosystem","Q.

These scenarios are derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). Four different storylines are analysed: the A1FI, A2, B1 and B2 'worlds'. The climate scenarios are derived from the HadCM3 climate model driven by the SRES emission scenarios. The SRES scenarios for global-mean sea-level rise range from 22cm (B1 world) to 34cm (A1FI world) by the 2080s, relative to 1990. All other climate factors, including storm characteristics, are assumed to remain constant in the long term. Population and GDP scenarios are downscaled from the SRES regional analyses supplemented with other relevant scenarios for each impact analysis. The flood model predicts that about 10 million people/year experienced coastal flooding due to surges in 1990. The incidence of flooding will change without sea-level rise, but these changes are strongly controlled by assumptions on protection. Assuming that defence standards improve with growth in GDP/capita (lagged by 30 years), flood incidence increases in all four cases to the 2020s due to the growing exposed population. Then to the 2080s, the incidence of flooding declined significantly to ≤5 million people/ year in the B2 world, ≤2 million people/year in the B1 world and ≤1 million people/year in the A1FI world due to improving defence standards. In contrast, flood incidence continues to increase in the A2 world to the 2050s, and in the 2080s it is still 18-30 million people/year. This reflects the greater exposure and more limited adaptive capacity of the A2 world, compared to the other SRES storylines. Sea-level rise increases the flood impacts in all cases although significant impacts are not apparent until the 2080s when the additional people flooded are 7-10 million, 29-50 million, 2-3 million and 16-27 million people/year under the A1FI, A2, B1 and B2 worlds, respectively. Hence, the A2 world also experiences the highest increase in the incidence of flooding. This is true under all the realistic scenario combinations that were considered demonstrating that socio-economic factors can greatly influence vulnerability to sea-level rise. The trends of the results also suggest that flood impacts due to sea-level rise could become much more severe through the 22nd century in all cases, especially in the A1FI world. Note that impacts using a climate model with a higher climate sensitivity would produce larger impacts than HadCM3. Coastal wetlands will be lost due to sea-level rise in all world futures with 5-20% losses by the 2080s in the A1FI world. However, these losses are relatively small compared to the potential for direct and indirect human destruction. Thus, the difference in environmental attitudes between the A1/A2 worlds and the B1/B2 worlds would seem to have more important implications for the future of coastal wetlands, than the magnitude of the sea-level rise scenarios during the 21st Century. These results should be seen as broad analysis of the sensitivity of the coastal system to the HadCM3 SRES global-mean sea-level rise scenarios. While these impact estimates are only for one climate model, for both impact factors they stress the importance of socio-economic conditions and other non-climate factors as a fundamental control on the magnitude of impacts both with and without sea-level rise. The A2 world experiences the largest impacts during the 21st century, while the B1 world has the smallest impacts, with the differences more reflecting socio-economic factors than climate change. This suggests that the role of development pathways in influencing the impacts of climate change needs to be given more attention. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

One group of soil fauna, the enchytraeids, is commonly the major soil faunal component in specific biomes, frequently exceeding above-ground fauna in biomass terms. These organisms have a crucial role in carbon turnover in organic rich soils and seem particularly sensitive to temperature changes. In order to predict the impacts of climate change on this important group of soil organisms we reviewed data from 44 published papers using a combination of conventional statistical techniques and meta-analysis. We focused on the effects of abiotic factors on total numbers of enchytraeids (a total of 611 observations) and, more specifically, concentrated on total numbers, vertical distribution and age groupings of the well-studied species Cognettia sphagnetorum (228 observations). The results highlight the importance of climatic factors, together with vegetation and soil type in determining global enchytraeid distribution; in particular, cold and wet environments with mild summers are consistently linked to greater densities of enchytraeids. Based on the upper temperature distribution limits reported in the literature, and identified from our meta-analyses, we also examined the probable future geographical limits of enchytraeid distribution in response to predicted global temperature changes using the HadCM3 model climate output for the period between 2010 and 2100. Based on the existing data we identify that a maximum mean annual temperature threshold of 16 °C could be a critical limit for present distribution of field populations, above which their presence would decline markedly, with certain key species, such as C. sphagnetorum, being totally lost from specific regions. We discuss the potential implications for carbon turnover in these organic soils where these organisms currently dominate and, consequently, their future role as C sink/source in response to climate change. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Abiotic factors; C cycling; Cognettia sphagnetorum; Enchytraeidae; Global warming; Meta-analysis; Soil fauna; Temperature limitation","Cognettia sphagnetorum; Enchytraeidae; aboveground biomass; biome; carbon cycle; carbon sink; climate change; climate effect; geographical distribution; global warming; meta-analysis; organic soil; soil fauna","M.J.I.

This paper presents an assessment framework that allows the identification of adaptation strategies that are robust (i.e. insensitive) to climate change uncertainties. The framework is applied to a case study of water resources management in the East of England, more specifically to the Anglian Water Services' 25 year Water Resource Plan (WRP). The paper presents a local sensitivity analysis (a 'one-at-a-time' experiment) of the various elements of the modelling framework (e.g., emissions of greenhouse gases, climate sensitivity and global climate models) in order to determine whether or not a decision to adapt to climate change is sensitive to uncertainty in those elements. Water resources are found to be sensitive to uncertainties in regional climate response (from general circulation models and dynamical downscaling), in climate sensitivity and in climate impacts. Aerosol forcing and greenhouse gas emissions uncertainties are also important, whereas uncertainties from ocean mixing and the carbon cycle are not. Despite these large uncertainties, Anglian Water Services' WRP remains robust to the climate change uncertainties sampled because of the adaptation options being considered (e.g. extension of water treatment works), because the climate model used for their planning (HadCM3) predicts drier conditions than other models, and because 'one-at-a-time' experiments do not sample the combination of different extremes in the uncertainty range of parameters. This research raises the question of how much certainty is required in climate change projections to justify investment in adaptation measures, and whether such certainty can be delivered. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Calculating this directly from global general circulation models (GCMs) is unreliable because the coarse resolution of 100 km or more is unable to capture narrow ablation zones, and ice dynamics is not usually taken into account in GCMs. To overcome these problems a high-resolution (20 km) dynamic ice sheet model has been coupled to the third Hadley Centre Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere GCM (HadCM3). A novel feature is the use of two-way coupling, so that climate changes in the GCM drive ice mass changes in the ice sheet model that, in turn, can alter the future climate through changes in orography, surface albedo, and freshwater input to the model ocean. At the start of the main experiment the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was increased to 4 times the preindustrial level and held constant for 3000 yr. By the end of this period the Greenland ice sheet is almost completely ablated and has made a direct contribution of approximately 7 m to global average sea level, causing a peak rate of sea level rise of 5 mm yr-1 early in the simulation. The effect of ice sheet depletion on global and regional climate has been examined and it was found that apart from the sea level rise, the long-term effect on global climate is small. However, there are some significant regional climate changes that appear to have reduced the rate at which the ice sheet ablates. © 2005 American Meteorological Society.","","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Sea level; atmosphere-ocean coupling; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; ice sheet; sea level change; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; General circulation model (GCM); Sea ice","J.K.

During the Mid-Holocene (6 ka), there was more summer insolation on the Northern Hemisphere than today, which intensified the meridional temperature and pressure gradients. Over North Africa, monsoonal precipitation is intensified through increased landward monsoon winds and moisture advection as well as decreased moisture convergence over the oceans and more convergence over land compared to the pre-industrial simulation. Precipitation also extends further north as the ITCZ shifts northward in response to the stronger poleward gradient of insolation. This increase and poleward extent is stronger than in most previous ocean-atmosphere GCM simulations. In north-westernmost Africa, precipitation extends up to 35°N. Over tropical Africa, internal feedbacks completely overcome the direct warming effect of increased insolation. We also find a weakened African Easterly Jet. Over Asia, monsoonal precipitation during the Mid-Holocene is increased as well, but the response is different than over North-Africa. There is more convection over land at the expense of convection over the ocean, but precipitation does not extend further northward, monsoon winds over the ocean are weaker and the surrounding ocean does not provide more moisture. On the Southern Hemisphere, summer insolation and the poleward insolation gradient were weaker during the Mid-Holocene, resulting in a reduced South American monsoon through decreased monsoon winds and less convection, as well as an equatorward shift in the ITCZ. This study corroborates the findings of paleodata research as well as previous model studies, while giving a more detailed account of Mid-Holocene monsoons. © Author(s) 2012.

Models participating in phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) and the current (fifth) version Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC5) developed by the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, National Institute for Environmental Studies, and Research Institute for Global Change (AORI/NIES/RIGC) are analyzed. Scores of a pattern similarity between precipitation in the models and that in observations are evaluated. The low score models (LSMs) overestimate (underestimate) precipitation over large-scale subsidence (ascending) regions compared to the high score models (HSMs). The sensitivity of deep convection to sea surface temperature (SST) and large-scale subsidence is examined; analysis suggests that dynamical suppression of deep convection by the entrainment of environmental dry air over the subsidence region is very weak, and deep convection follows SST closely in LSMs. For example, deep convective activity is identified over the southeastern Pacific in LSMs, which corresponds to the double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) problem. It is suggested that the double ITCZ is associated not only with the local SST but also with the precipitation schemes that control deep convection over the entire tropical oceans. The current version, MIROC5, reproduces precipitation distributions significantly better than the older versions. Precipitation in MIROC5 has a weaker correlation with SST and a stronger correlation with environmental humidity than that in LSMs. The realistic representation of entrainment in regions with dynamical suppression is suggested to be a key factor for better reproducibility of precipitation distributions. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Intertropical convergence zone; Model comparison; Model evaluation/performance; Precipitation; Sea surface temperature","Air entrainment; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Natural convection; Oceanography; Precipitation (chemical); Research; Subsidence; Surface properties; Tropics; Convective activity; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Deep convection; Dry air; Environmental studies; Global change; In-phase; Interdisciplinary research; Intertropical convergence zone; Key factors; Model comparison; Model evaluation/performance; Ocean research; Pattern similarity; Precipitation distribution; Reproducibilities; Research institutes; Sea surface temperatures; Tropical ocean; Version model; climate modeling; intertropical convergence zone; precipitation (climatology); precipitation assessment; sea surface temperature; Climate models","N.

Around a third of the global-mean SLR over the century is avoided by a mitigation scenario under which global-mean near surface air temperature stabilises close to the Copenhagen Accord limit of a 2C increase. Under BAU (a variant of the A1B scenario) the model-averaged projected SLR for 2090-2099 relative to 1980-1999 is 0.29 m-0.51 m (5%-95% uncertainties from treatment of land-based ice melt); under mitigation (E1 scenario) it is 0.17 m-0.34 m. This reduction is primarily from reduced thermal expansion. The spatial patterns of regional SLR are fairly dissimilar between the models, but are qualitatively similar across scenarios for a particular model. An impacts model suggests that by the end of the 21st century and without upgrade in defences around 55% of the 84 million additional people flooded per year globally under BAU (from SLR alone) could be avoided under such mitigation. The above projections of SLR follow the methodology of the IPCC Fourth Assessment. We have, however, also conducted a sensitivity study of SLR and its impacts where the possibility of accelerated ice sheet dynamics is accounted for.

The robustness of this projection to both uncertainty in physical climate drivers and the formulation of the land surface scheme is investigated. We analyse how the modelled vegetation cover in Amazonia responds to (i) uncertainty in the parameters specified in the atmosphere component of HadCM3 and their associated influence on predicted surface climate. We then enhance the land surface description and (ii) implement a multilayer canopy light interception model and compare with the simple 'big-leaf' approach used in the original simulations. Finally, (iii) we investigate the effect of changing the method of simulating vegetation dynamics from an area-based model (TRIFFID) to a more complex size- and age-structured approximation of an individual-based model (ecosystem demography).We find that the loss of Amazonian rainforest is robust across the climate uncertainty explored by perturbed physics simulations covering a wide range of global climate sensitivity. The introduction of the refined light interception model leads to an increase in simulated gross plant carbon uptake for the present day, but, with altered respiration, the net effect is a decrease in net primary productivity. However, this does not significantly affect the carbon loss from vegetation and soil as a consequence of future simulated depletion in soil moisture; the Amazon forest is still lost. The introduction of the more sophisticated dynamic vegetation model reduces but does not halt the rate of forest dieback. The potential for human-induced climate change to trigger the loss of Amazon rainforest appears robust within the context of the uncertainties explored in this paper. Some further uncertainties should be explored, particularly with respect to the representation of rooting depth. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Amazonia; Carbon cycle; Climate change; Die-back; Ecosystems; Global warming","Amazonia; South America; atmospheric general circulation model; carbon cycle; comparative study; dieback; ecosystem modeling; forest dynamics; global climate; global warming; human activity; net primary production; nutrient uptake; rainforest; soil moisture; uncertainty analysis; vegetation cover","C.

While some modelled quantities respond almost immediately to the atmospheric CO2 concentrations, others exhibit a time lag relative to the change in CO 2. Most quantities also exhibit a lag relative to the global-mean surface temperature change, which can be described as a hysteresis behaviour. The most surprising responses are from low-level clouds and ocean stratification in the Southern Ocean, which both exhibit hysteresis on timescales longer than expected. We see no evidence of critical thresholds in these simulations, although some of the hysteresis phenomena become more apparent above 2×CO2 or 3×CO2.

We start with the early experiments on Amazon deforestation in the late 1970s, and the evolution of these experiments to the latest studies on greenhouse gases emission scenarios and land use changes until the end of the twenty-first century. The ""Amazon dieback"" simulated by the HadCM3 model occurs after a ""tipping point"" of CO2 concentration and warming. Experiments on Amazon deforestation and change of climate suggest that once a critical deforestation threshold (or tipping point) of 40-50% forest loss is reached in eastern Amazonia, climate would change in a way which is dangerous for the remaining forest. This may favor a collapse of the tropical forest, with a substitution of the forest by savanna-type vegetation. The concept of ""dangerous climate change,"" as a climate change, which induces positive feedback, which accelerate the change, is strongly linked to the occurrence of tipping points, and it can be explained as the presence of feedback between climate change and the carbon cycle, particularly involving a weakening of the current terrestrial carbon sink and a possible reversal from a sink (as in present climate) to a source by the year 2050. We must, therefore, currently consider the drying simulated by the Hadley Centre model(s) as having a finite probability under global warming, with a potentially enormous impact, but with some degree of uncertainty. © 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.

This model is an overall upgrade of MRI's former climate model MRI-CGCM2 series. MRI-CGCM3 is composed of atmosphere-land, aerosol, and ocean-ice models, and is a subset of the MRI's earth system model MRI-ESM1. Atmospheric component MRI-AGCM3 is interactively coupled with aerosol model to represent direct and indirect e{currency sign}ects of aerosols with a new cloud microphysics scheme. Basic experiments for pre-industrial control, historical and climate sensitivity are performed with MRI-CGCM3. In the pre-industrial control experiment, the model exhibits very stable behavior without climatic drifts, at least in the radiation budget, the temperature near the surface and the major indices of ocean circulations. The sea surface temperature (SST) drift is sufficiently small, while there is a 1 W m -2 heating imbalance at the surface. The model's climate sensitivity is estimated to be 2.11 K with Gregory's method. The transient climate response (TCR) to 1 % yr -1 increase of carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration is 1.6 K with doubling of CO 2 concentration and 4.1 K with quadrupling of CO 2 concentration. The simulated present-day mean climate in the historical experiment is evaluated by comparison with observations, including reanalysis. The model reproduces the overall mean climate, including seasonal variation in various aspects in the atmosphere and the oceans. Variability in the simulated climate is also evaluated and is found to be realistic, including El Nin ̃o and Southern Oscillation and the Arctic and Antarctic oscillations. However, some important issues are identified. The simulated SST indicates generally cold bias in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and warm bias in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), and the simulated sea ice expands excessively in the North Atlantic in winter. A double ITCZ also appears in the tropical Pacific, particularly in the austral summer. © 2012, Meteorological Society of Japan.","","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); aerosol; air temperature; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; climate variation; cloud microphysics; concentration (composition); El Nino-Southern Oscillation; global climate; intertropical convergence zone; meteorology; Northern Hemisphere; oceanic circulation; sea ice; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; Southern Hemisphere","S.

Two versions of ACCESS-CM have been submitted to CMIP; namely CSIRO-BOM ACCESS1.0 and CSIRO-BOM ACCESS1.3. Results from six of the core CMIP5 experiments (piControl, historical, rcp45, rcp85, 1pctCO2, and abrupt4xCO2) are evaluated for each of the two ACCESS-CM model versions. Overall, both model versions exhibit a reasonable and stable representation of key diagnostics of ocean climate performance in the pre-industrial control simulations, including a meridional overturning circulation with North Atlantic Deep Water maxima in the range 22-24 Sv, and a poleward heat transport maximum of around 1.5 PW. For the projected climate change scenarios considered the ACCESS-CM results are in reasonable agreement with responses found in other CMIP models, with the familiar ocean warming, and reduction in strength of meridional overturning and poleward heat transport. Drifts in the control simulations of both global ocean salinity and global sea-level are opposite in sign for ACCESS1.0 and ACCESS1.3, suggesting problems exist in the closure of the hydrological cycle. The simulation of ocean climate change over the historical period shows a weak response compared to observations, which manifests as a late response of ocean warming and sea level rise starting around 1990 in the model, compared to the mid 1960s in observations. Further historical simulations are underway to ascertain if this late response in ACCESS is a robust model feature, or just low frequency variability. If the weak response over the historical period proves robust, the likely cause is a too strong cooling from atmospheric aerosols. Broadening the set of experiments to further investigate the relative warming response of the ACCESS-CM to greenhouse gases compared to the cooling response to aerosols is underway, and preliminary results do suggest that the cooling due to aerosols is strong in the historical simulations.

Given that the preindustrial control run using MIROC5 shows a realistic ENSO, the integration is repeated with four different values of the parameter, l, which affects the efficiency of the entrainment rate in cumuli. The ENSO amplitude is found to be proportional to l21 and to vary from 0.6 to 1.6 K. A comparison of four experiments reveals the mechanisms for which the cumulus convections control behavior of ENSO in MIROC as follows. Efficient entrainment due to a large l increases congestus clouds over the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and reduces the vertical temperature gradient over the eastern Pacific, resulting in a wetter ITCZ and drier cold tongue via accelerated meridional circulation. The dry cold tongue then shifts the atmospheric responses to El Niño/La Niña westward, thereby reducing the effective Bjerknes feedback. The first half of these processes is identifiable in a companion set of atmosphere model experiments, but the difference in mean precipitation contrast is quite small. On one hand, the mean meridional precipitation contrast over the eastern Pacific is a relevant indicator of the ENSO amplitude in MIROC. On the other hand, the nonlinear feedback from ENSO affects the mean state, the latter therefore not regarded as a fundamental cause for different ENSO amplitudes. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Convection; Cumulus clouds; ENSO; Entrainment; Feedback; Precipitation","Atmospheric pressure; Behavioral research; Climate models; Computer simulation; Feedback; Nickel compounds; Nonlinear feedback; State feedback; Convection; Cumulus cloud; ENSO; Entrainment; Precipitation; climate feedback; computer simulation; cumulus; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; entrainment; intertropical convergence zone; precipitation (climatology); Clouds","M.

This study simulated the carbon cycles under these changes using process-based ecosystem models. The Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS), a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM), was used to evaluate the impacts of climate change and CO 2 fertilization on net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and the vegetation structure of terrestrial ecosystems in Zhejiang province (area 101,800 km 2, mainly covered by subtropical evergreen forest and warm-temperate evergreen broadleaf forest) which is located in the subtropical climate area of China. Two general circulation models (HADCM3 and CGCM3) representing four IPCC climate change scenarios (HC3AA, HC3GG, CGCM-sresa2, and CGCM-sresb1) were used as climate inputs for IBIS. Results show that simulated historical biomass and NPP are consistent with field and other modelled data, which makes the analysis of future carbon budget reliable. The results indicate that NPP over the entire Zhejiang province was about 55 Mt C yr -1 during the last half of the 21 st century. An NPP increase of about 24 Mt C by the end of the 21 st century was estimated with the combined effects of increasing CO 2 and climate change. A slight NPP increase of about 5 Mt C was estimated under the climate change alone scenario. Forests in Zhejiang are currently acting as a carbon sink with an average NEP of about 2.5 Mt C yr -1. NEP will increase to about 5 Mt C yr -1 by the end of the 21 st century with the increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration and climate change. However, climate change alone will reduce the forest carbon sequestration of Zhejiang's forests. Future climate warming will substantially change the vegetation cover types; warm-temperate evergreen broadleaf forest will be gradually substituted by subtropical evergreen forest. An increasing CO 2 concentration will have little contribution to vegetation changes. Simulated NPP shows geographic patterns consistent with temperature to a certain extent, and precipitation is not the limiting factor for forest NPP in the subtropical climate conditions. There is no close relationship between the spatial pattern of NEP and climate condition.","Carbon cycle; DGVM; Dynamic global vegetation model; Global warming; NEP; Net ecosystem production; Net primary production; NPP; Subtropical China; Vegetation change","China; Zhejiang; biomass; broad-leaved forest; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; climate conditions; ecosystem modeling; evergreen forest; forecasting method; general circulation model; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; net ecosystem production; net primary production; subtropical region; vegetation cover","H.

Simulations of the distribution of permafrost in the 21st century made with the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) indicate that substantial decreases in permafrost extent can be expected, especially under high emissions scenarios. One of the implications of permafrost loss is the potential release of carbon from newly thawed soils into the atmosphere, thus raising its concentration of greenhouse gases and amplifying the initial warming trend. However, the biogeochemical cycle simulated by CCSM4 presents significant biases in carbon fluxes such as gross primary production, net primary production, and vegetation carbon storage in permafrost regions. The biases in the carbon cycle simulated by CCSM4 are in part due to excessively dry soils in permafrost regions. In this study, we show that the CCSM4 dry soil bias results from the model's formulation of soil hydraulic permeability when soil ice is present. The calculation of the hydraulic properties of frozen soils is first modified by replacing their dependence on total water content with liquid water content only. Then an ice impedance function having a power-law form is incorporated. When the parameterization of the hydraulic properties of frozen soil is corrected, the model simulates significantly higher moisture contents in near-surface soils in permafrost regions, especially during spring. This result is validated qualitatively by comparing soil moisture profiles to descriptions based on field studies, and quantitatively by comparing simulated hydrographs of two large Siberian rivers to observed hydrographs. After the dry soil bias is reduced, the vegetation productivity simulated by the model is improved, which is manifested in leaf area indices that at some locations are twice as large as in the original model. © 2012.

From these projections, temperature rise from 1850 to 2100 ranged from 2.4 K in the RCP2.6 scenario to 6.2 K in the RCP8.5 scenario. We found that there are discrepancies between the RCPs and the estimates of our model in both allowable fossil fuel and land-use change emissions. The former showed systematic discrepancies likely due to strong positive feedbacks in the model, but the latter did not. The likely reason for the difference in land-use emissions is the modeling of land-use change processes or definitions for the emission. Climate response to the increase of atmospheric carbon showed large variation among scenarios, strongly affected by ocean heat uptake efficiency that could depend on the rate of atmospheric CO 2 increase in each scenario. Large variation between scenarios was also found in carbon cycle sensitivity measured by cumulative airborne fraction. The variation in carbon cycle sensitivity may be attributable to the dependence of concentration-carbon feedback on the rate of atmospheric CO 2 increase. The earth system would show a similar response to emitted carbon during the 21st century if the difference of ocean heat uptake efficiency between scenarios were small. The earth system responds to RCP6.0 with less sensitivity to emitted carbon when compared with other scenarios because of high-efficiency carbon uptakes by land and ocean ecosystems. In contrast, RCP2.6 showed high sensitivity of the earth system to carbon emission, and apparently showed different behavior from other scenarios due to early reduction of GHGs. © 2012, Meteorological Society of Japan.","","aerosol; air temperature; anthropogenic effect; carbon cycle; carbon emission; climate change; climate feedback; concentration (composition); fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; land use change","T.

The main aim of the study was to obtain a preliminary characterization of the autotrophic community structure of a poorly investigated and complex basin during two contrasting seasonal conditions (stratification vs homogeneity). On both occasions the phytoplankton biomass, as chlorophyll a, was low in the euphotic layer of water column (8.9 mg m-2 in July and 10.7 mg m-2 in December), with a clear dominance of the pico-phytoplanktonic component (64% and 76%, respectively), and a pronounced summer Deep Chlorophyll Maximum. Interestingly, primary production was higher in December (429 mg C m-2 d-1) than July (273 mg C m-2 d-1), again with a major contribution of pico-class in both seasons (90% and 52% in late autumn and summer, respectively). The dominant contribution of small size classes to the total photosynthetic efficiency and their fast carbon turnover time within the community hint at a preferential carbon pathway through the small-sized components of the food web that contrasts with the traditional views of the Tyrrhenian Sea as a typical component of the temperate Western Mediterranean Sea. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

It uses most of the same code as HadCM3, a widely used climate model of higher resolution and computational cost, and has been tuned to reproduce the same climate reasonably well. FAMOUS is useful for climate simulations where the computational cost makes the application of HadCM3 unfeasible, either because of the length of simulation or the size of the ensemble desired. We document a number of scientific and technical improvements to the original version of FAMOUS. These improvements include changes to the parameterisations of ozone and sea-ice which alleviate a significant cold bias from high northern latitudes and the upper troposphere, and the elimination of volume-averaged drifts in ocean tracers. A simple model of the marine carbon cycle has also been included. A particular goal of FAMOUS is to conduct millennial-scale paleoclimate simulations of Quaternary ice ages; to this end, a number of useful changes to the model infrastructure have been made. © 2008 Author(s).

We used the regional hydro-ecological simulation system RHESSys in five case study catchments from different climatic zones in the European Alps to investigate the behavior of the carbon cycle under changing climatic and land cover conditions derived from the SRES scenarios of the IPCC. The focus of this study was on analyzing the differences in carbon cycling across various climatic zones of the Alps, and to explore the differences between the impacts of various SRES scenarios (A1FI, A2, B1, B2), and between several global circulation models (GCMs, i.e., HadCM3, CGCM2, CSIRO2, PCM). The simulation results indicate that the warming trend generally enhances carbon sequestration in these catchments over the first half of the twenty-first century, particularly in forests just below treeline. Thereafter, forests at low elevations increasingly release carbon as a consequence of the changed balance between growth and respiration processes, resulting in a net carbon source at the catchment scale. Land cover changes have a strong modifying effect on these climate-induced patterns. While the simulated temporal pattern of carbon cycling is qualitatively similar across the five catchments, quantitative differences exist due to the regional differences of the climate and land cover scenarios, with land cover exerting a stronger influence. The differences in the simulations with scenarios derived from several GCMs under one SRES scenario are of the same magnitude as the differences between various SRES scenarios derived from one single GCM, suggesting that the uncertainty in climate model projections needs to be narrowed before accurate impact assessments under the various SRES scenarios can be made at the local to regional scale. We conclude that the carbon balance of the European Alps is likely to shift strongly in the future, driven mainly by land cover changes, but also by changes of the climate. We recommend that assessments of carbon cycling at regional to continental scales should make sure to adequately include sub-regional differences of changes in climate and land cover, particularly in areas with a complex topography. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","","Alps; Eurasia; Europe; Catchments; Computer simulation; Ecology; Global warming; Land use; Sensitivity analysis; carbon sequestration; catchment; climate modeling; global change; land cover; mountain region; respiration; sensitivity analysis; Carbon cycling; Impact assessments; Land cover; Carbon","H.

Changes in the mass of the ocean were not included. In the global mean, salinity changes have a negligible effect compared with the thermal expansion of the ocean. Regionally, sea level changes are projected to deviate greatly from the global mean (standard deviation is 40% of the mean). Changes in surface fluxes of heat, freshwater and wind stress are all found to produce significant and distinct regional sea level changes, wind stress changes being the most important and the cause of several pronounced local features, while heat and freshwater flux changes affect large parts of the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. Regional change is related mainly to density changes, with a relatively small contribution in mid and high latitudes from change in the barotropic circulation. Regional density change has an important contribution from redistribution of ocean heat content. In general, unlike in the global mean, the regional pattern of sea level change due to density change appears to be influenced almost as much by salinity changes as by temperature changes, often in opposition. Such compensation is particularly marked in the North Atlantic, where it is consistent with recent observed changes. We suggest that density compensation is not a property of climate change specifically, but a general behavior of the ocean.

Significant increases in central and eastern Amazonia are simulated by 2020, and high fire danger for over 50% of the forest is simulated in all model runs by 2080. By 2080, as much as 25% of Amazonia shows high levels of agreement in projections of combined fire risk and deforestation.

In this paper, we quantify these effects for a doubling of CO2using a low resolution configuration of the coupled model NCAR CCSM4. In contrast to previous coupled climate-carbon modeling studies, we focus on the near-equilibrium response of the terrestrial carbon cycle. For a doubling of CO2, the radiative effect on the physical climate system causes global mean surface air temperature to increase by 2. 14 K, whereas the physiological and fertilization on the land biosphere effects cause a warming of 0. 22 K, suggesting that these later effects increase global warming by about 10 % as found in many recent studies. The CO2-fertilization leads to total ecosystem carbon gain of 371 Gt-C (28 %) while the radiative effect causes a loss of 131 Gt-C (~10 %) indicating that climate warming damps the fertilization-induced carbon uptake over land. Our model-based estimate for the maximum potential terrestrial carbon uptake resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2concentration (285-570 ppm) is only 242 Gt-C. This highlights the limited storage capacity of the terrestrial carbon reservoir. We also find that the terrestrial carbon storage sensitivity to changes in CO2and temperature have been estimated to be lower in previous transient simulations because of lags in the climate-carbon system. Our model simulations indicate that the time scale of terrestrial carbon cycle response is greater than 500 years for CO2-fertilization and about 200 years for temperature perturbations. We also find that dynamic changes in vegetation amplify the terrestrial carbon storage sensitivity relative to a static vegetation case: because of changes in tree cover, changes in total ecosystem carbon for CO2-direct and climate effects are amplified by 88 and 72 %, respectively, in simulations with dynamic vegetation when compared to static vegetation simulations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon cycle feedback; Climate change; Terrestrial carbon cycle","atmospheric chemistry; biosphere; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; concentration (composition); physiological response; radiative forcing; sensitivity analysis; terrestrial ecosystem; warming","G.

There is currently little confidence in the prediction of El Niño for seasonal forecasts or climate change due to the inaccuracies in coupled models. If heat flux or wind stress corrections could reduce these biases then forecasts might be improved. Heat flux corrections have unexpected effects on both the mean state and variability of HadCM3. HadCM3 is found to be very sensitive to the corrections imposed. If heat flux corrections are imposed Tropics wide then easterlies in the eastern equatorial Pacific are increased leading to localized steep east-west gradients in the thermocline or ""thermocline jumps,"" which appear to suppress propagation of heat from the west to the east and hence suppress strong El Niños so that ENSO variability is weak. In contrast, if heat flux corrections are imposed only within 10° of the equator, an atmospheric teleconnection from the cold subtropical SST biases intensifies the ITCZ and weakens the equatorial easterlies. As a result, the thermocline jumps are flattened and strong El Niños occur very frequently. Neither heat flux correction procedure improves the representation of El Niño. Wind stress corrections alone have a small impact on the coupled model. Some of the SST warm biases are reduced, but the variability is not altered significantly. © 2007 American Meteorological Society.","","Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial); Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Computer simulation; Heat flux; Weather forecasting; Wind stress; atmospheric general circulation model; climate modeling; coupling; easterly wave; El Nino; error correction; Hadley cell; heat flux; oceanic general circulation model; sea surface temperature; teleconnection; thermocline; wind stress; Coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model; Heat flux correction; Thermocline jumps; Climatology","H.

HOMME is a petascale-capable high-order element based conservative dynamical core developed on the cubed-sphere grid. Initial simulations have been completed in an aquaplanet configuration of the Community Atmosphere Model, version 4 (CAM4), the atmospheric component of CCSM4. The authors examined the results of this simulation and assessed its fidelity in simulating rainfall, which is one of the most important components of the earth's climate system. For this they compared the results from two other dynamical cores of CAM4: the finite volume (FV) and Eulerian (EUL). Instantaneous features of rainfall in HOMME are similar to FV and EUL. Similar to EUL and FV, HOMME simulates a single-peak intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) over the equator. The strength of the ITCZ is found to be almost the same in HOMME and EUL but more in FV. It is observed that in HOMME and EUL, there is higher surface evaporation, which supplies more moisture to the deep tropics and gives more rainfall over the ITCZ. The altitude of maximum precipitation is found to be at almost the same level in all three dynamical cores. The eastward propagation of rainfall bands is organized and more prominent in FV and HOMME than in EUL. The phase speed of the eastward propagation in HOMME is found to be higher than in FV. The results show that, in general, the rainfall simulated by HOMME falls in a regime between that of FV and EUL. Hence, they conclude that the key aspects of rainfall simulation with HOMME falls into an acceptable range, as compared to the existing dynamical cores used in the model. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.","Climate models; General circulation models; Rainfall","Computer simulation; Dynamical systems; Earth (planet); Rain; Spheres; Atmospheric components; Community atmosphere model; Community climate system model; Dynamical core; Earth's climate; Eastward propagation; Eulerian; Finite volume; General circulation model; High order element; High-order methods; Intertropical convergence zone; Modeling environments; Phase speed; Rainfall simulations; Surface evaporation; atmospheric dynamics; atmospheric moisture; climate modeling; computer simulation; general circulation model; intertropical convergence zone; rainfall; Climate models","S.K.

One is the standard 1%/yr increase of CO2 concentration until it quadrupled the pre-industrial level at the 140 year experiment (1pctCO2) and the others are two diagnosis experiments, which are used to isolated the impact of climate change alone (esmFdbk1) and CO2 concentration changes alone (esmFixClim1) on surface carbon fluxes. The experiments were carried out with several coupled climate models. Although there are large variations in the magnitude of the precipitation flux among the models, the majority of the models show an obvious seasonal patterns of NPP, surface air temperature and precipitation flux. During 140 year long simulations, global NPP increasing steadily when CO2 concentration quadrupled and climate changed together or CO2 increasing alone, the growth rates can reach up to 0.31%/ yr (MPI-ESM-LR simulated). However, there is a down trend of global NPP when climate changed alone. NPP changes are not consistent around the world, influenced by CO2 increase and climate change, higher NPP are most distributed in southern Africa, Amazon basin and southeast coastal regions in the northern hemisphere, CO2 increase due to climate change also has a positive impact on global NPP at the end of the simulation. Nevertheless, no matter what the situation, climate change alone or climate change resulted from CO2 increase both are not good for NPP accumulation on global scale. The relationship between annual NPP and climatic variables shows temperature rising in the growth season has significant effects on NPP increase in the mid and high latitudes of northern hemisphere, while NPP in arid or semi-arid regions in the southern hemisphere is mainly limited by precipitation.","Climate; Model; NPP; Precipitation; Temperature","carbon dioxide; nitrogen; water; air temperature; article; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide fixation; climate change; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; high temperature; nutrient availability; photosynthesis; precipitation; primary production (biomass); seasonal variation; simulation; vegetation","S.

(1993) is extended to a dynamic analysis. It considers the effects of several simultaneously changing factors, including: (1) global sea-level rise and subsidence; (2) increasing coastal population; and (3) improving standards of flood defence (using GNP/capita as an 'ability-to-pay' parameter). The global sea-level rise scenarios are derived from two General Circulation Model (GCM) experiments of the Hadley Centre: (1) the HadCM2 greenhouse gas only ensemble experiment and (2) the more recent HadCM3 greenhouse gas only experiment. In all cases there is a global rise in sea level of about 38 cm from 1990 to the 2080s. No other climate change is considered. Relative to an evolving reference scenario without sea-level rise, this analysis suggests that the number of people flooded by storm surge in a typical year will be more than five times higher due to sea-level rise by the 2080s. Many of these people will experience annual or more frequent flooding, suggesting that the increase in flood frequency will be more than nuisance level and some response (increased protection, migration, etc.) will be required. In absolute terms, the areas most vulnerable to flooding are the southern Mediterranean, Africa, and most particularly, South and South-east Asia where there is a concentration of low-lying populated deltas. However, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean islands and the Pacific Ocean small islands may experience the largest relative increase in flood risk. By the 2080s, sea-level rise could cause the loss of up to 22% of the world's coastal wetlands. When combined with other losSeS due to direct human action, up to 70% of the world's coastal wetlands could be lost by the 2080s, although there is considerable uncertainty. Therefore, sea-level rise would reinforce other adverse trends of wetland loss. The largest losses due to sea-level rise will be around the Mediterranean and Baltic and to a lesser extent on the Atlantic coast of Central and North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean. Collectively, these results show that a relatively small global rise in sea level could have significant adverse impacts if there is no adaptive response. Given the 'commitment to sea-level rise' irrespective of any realistic future emissions policy, there is a need to start strategic planning of appropriate responses now. Given that coastal flooding and wetland loss are already important problems, such planning could have immediate benefits.","Adaption; Climate change; Costs; Impacts","coastal zone management; flood; habitat loss; sea level change; wetland","R.J.

The GFDL CM2.5 has an atmospheric resolution of approximately 50 km in the horizontal, with 32 vertical levels. The horizontal resolution in the ocean ranges from 28 km in the tropics to 8 km at high latitudes, with 50 vertical levels. This resolution allows the explicit simulation of some mesoscale eddies in the ocean, particularly at lower latitudes. Analyses are presented based on the output of a 280-yr control simulation; also presented are results based on a 140-yr simulation in which atmospheric CO 2 increases at 1% yr -1 until doubling after 70 yr. Results are compared to GFDL CM2.1, which has somewhat similar physics but a coarser resolution. The simulated climate in CM2.5 shows marked improvement over many regions, especially the tropics, including a reduction in the double ITCZ and an improved simulation of ENSO. Regional precipitation features are much improved. The Indian monsoon and Amazonian rainfall are also substantially more realistic in CM2.5. The response of CM2.5 to a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 has many features in common with CM2.1, with some notable differences. For example, rainfall changes over the Mediterranean appear to be tightly linked to topography in CM2.5, in contrast to CM2.1 where the response is more spatially homogeneous. In addition, in CM2.5 the near-surface ocean warms substantially in the high latitudes of the Southern Ocean, in contrast to simulations using CM2.1.","Air-sea interaction; Climate models; Model evaluation/performance; Ocean circulation; Ocean models","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Oceanography; Rain; Tropics; Air sea interactions; Atmospheric CO; Coarser resolution; Control simulation; Coupled climate model; Geophysical fluid dynamics laboratories; Global climate model; High Latitudes; High resolution; Horizontal resolution; Indian monsoon; Mesoscale eddy; Model evaluation; Near-surface; Ocean circulation; Ocean model; Ocean range; Southern ocean; air-sea interaction; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate change; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; mesoscale eddy; oceanic circulation; Climate models","T.L.

A diagnostic approach is used to elucidate the mechanism that governs the variability and its impacts on climate. An irregular and heavily damped THC oscillation with a period around 25 yr is identified. The oscillation appears to be forced by the atmosphere but the ocean is responsible for setting the time scale. Following a minimum in the THC, the mechanism for phase reversal involves the accumulation of cold water in the subpolar gyre, leading to an acceleration of the gyre circulation and the North Atlantic Current. This acceleration increases the transport of saline waters into the regions of active deep convection, raising the upper-ocean density and leading, after adjustment, to acceleration of the THC. The atmosphere stimulates this THC variability in two ways: 1) by forcing the subpolar gyre through (North Atlantic Oscillation) NAO-related wind stress curl and heat flux anomalies; and 2) by direct forcing of the region of active deep convection, also through wind stress curl and heat flux anomalies. The latter is not closely related to the NAO. The mechanism for phase reversal has many similarities to that found in a previous study with a much lower resolution coupled model, suggesting that this mechanism may be quite robust. However the time scale, and details of the atmospheric forcing, differ. The THC variability in HadCM3 has significant impacts on the atmosphere not just in the Atlantic region but also more widely, throughout the global Tropics. The mechanism involves modulation by the THC of the cross-equator SST gradient in the tropical Atlantic. The SST anomalies induce a displacement of the ITCZ in the Atlantic basin with knock-on effects over the other ocean basins. These findings highlight the potential importance of the Atlantic THC as a cause of interdecadal climate variability on a global scale.","","Atmospheric pressure; Climate change; Heat convection; Heat flux; Mathematical models; Saline water; atmosphere-ocean coupling; thermohaline circulation; Diagnostic approach; Gyre circulations; North Atlantic Currents; Thermohaline circulations (THC); Ocean engineering","B.

Global-mean surface temperature change during the twentieth century is well reproduced. Simulated contributions to global-mean sea level rise during recent decades due to thermal expansion (the largest term) and to mass loss from glaciers and ice caps agree within uncertainties with observational estimates of these terms, but their sum falls short of the observed rate of sea level rise. This discrepancy has been discussed by previous authors; a completely satisfactory explanation of twentieth-century sea level rise is lacking. The model suggests that the apparent onset of sea level rise and glacier retreat during the first part of the nineteenth century was due to natural forcing. The rate of sea level rise was larger during the twentieth century than during the previous centuries because of anthropogenic forcing, but decreasing natural forcing during the second half of the twentieth century tended to offset the anthropogenic acceleration in the rate. Volcanic eruptions cause rapid falls in sea level, followed by recovery over several decades. The model shows substantially less decadal variability in sea level and its thermal expansion component than twentieth-century observations indicate, either because it does not generate sufficient ocean internal variability, or because the observational analyses overestimate the variability.","","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Computer simulation; Sea level; Thermal expansion; Decadal variability; Global-mean surface temperature; Volcanic eruptions; atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric forcing; computer simulation; general circulation model; sea level change; sea surface temperature; Climatology","J.M.

This model represents biogeochemical, biophysical and biogeographical processes, coupling the carbon, nitrogen and water cycles on a sub-daily timestep, simulating potential vegetation and transient changes in annual growth and competition between eight generalized plant types in response to climate. Global vegetation carbon was predicted to rise from about 600 to 800 PgC (or to 650 PgC for HadCM3) while the soil carbon pool of about 1100 PgC decreased by about 8%. By the 2080s, climate change caused a partial loss of Amazonian rainforest, C4 grasslands and temperate forest in areas of southern Europe and eastern USA, but an expansion in the boreal forest area. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation in many tropical areas, southern Europe and eastern USA (in response to warming and a decrease in rainfall), but an increase in NPP of boreal forests. Global NPP increased from 45 to 50 PgC y-1 in the 1990s to about 65 PgC y-1 in the 2080s (about 58 PgC y-1 for HadCM3). Global net ecosystem productivity (NEP) increased from about 1.3 PgC y-1 in the 1990s to about 3.6 PgC y-1 in the 2030s and then declined to zero by 2100 owing to a loss of carbon from declining forests in the tropics and at warm temperate latitudes - despite strengthening of the carbon sink at northern high latitudes. HadCM3 gave a more erratic temporal evolution of NEP than HadCM2, with a dramatic collapse in NEP in the 2050s.","Carbon sink; Climate change; Elevated CO<sub>2</sub>","biogeochemical process; biophysics; carbon dioxide; climate; environmental fate; environmental impact assessment; Europe; forest; grassland; model; nitrogen deposition; plant growth; simulation; tropics; United Kingdom; United States; carbon cycle; climate change; ecosystem health","A.

This model includes an interactive carbon cycle, a representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, and a comprehensive representation of aerosols. As it represents the principal dynamical, physical, and bio-geochemical processes relevant to the climate system, it may be referred to as an Earth System Model. However, the IPSL-CM5 model may be used in a multitude of configurations associated with different boundary conditions and with a range of complexities in terms of processes and interactions. This paper presents an overview of the different model components and explains how they were coupled and used to simulate historical climate changes over the past 150 years and different scenarios of future climate change. A single version of the IPSL-CM5 model (IPSL-CM5A-LR) was used to provide climate projections associated with different socio-economic scenarios, including the different Representative Concentration Pathways considered by CMIP5 and several scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios considered by CMIP3. Results suggest that the magnitude of global warming projections primarily depends on the socio-economic scenario considered, that there is potential for an aggressive mitigation policy to limit global warming to about two degrees, and that the behavior of some components of the climate system such as the Arctic sea ice and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation may change drastically by the end of the twenty-first century in the case of a no climate policy scenario. Although the magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes depends fairly linearly on the magnitude of the projected global warming (and thus on the scenario considered), the geographical pattern of these changes is strikingly similar for the different scenarios. The representation of atmospheric physical processes in the model is shown to strongly influence the simulated climate variability and both the magnitude and pattern of the projected climate changes. © 2013 The Author(s).","Aerosols; Allowable emissions; Carbon cycle; Climate; Climate change; Climate projections; CMIP3; CMIP5; Earth System Model; Greenhouse gases; Land use changes; RCP scenarios","Arctic Ocean; aerosol; carbon cycle; carbon emission; climate change; climate modeling; general circulation model; global warming; greenhouse gas; land use change; meridional circulation; overturn; sea ice; stratosphere; troposphere","J.-L.

At this boundary, warm circumpolar water can override the continental slope front, reaching the grounding line through submarine glacial troughs and causing high rates of melting at the deep ice-shelf bases. The interplay between ocean currents and continental bathymetry is therefore likely to influence future rates of ice-mass loss. Here we show that a redirection of the coastal current into the Filchner Trough and underneath the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf during the second half of the twenty-first century would lead to increased movement of warm waters into the deep southern ice-shelf cavity. Water temperatures in the cavity would increase by more than 2 degrees Celsius and boost average basal melting from 0.2 metres, or 82 billion tonnes, per year to almost 4 metres, or 1, 600 billion tonnes, per year. Our results, which are based on the output of a coupled ice-ocean model forced by a range of atmospheric outputs from the HadCM3 climate model, suggest that the changes would be caused primarily by an increase in ocean surface stress in the southeastern Weddell Sea due to thinning of the formerly consolidated sea-ice cover. The projected ice loss at the base of the Filchner Ronne Ice Shelf represents 80 per cent of the present Antarctic surface mass balance. Thus, the quantification of basal mass loss under changing climate conditions is important for projections regarding the dynamics of Antarctic ice streams and ice shelves, and global sea level rise. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","","Antarctica; Southern Ocean; Weddell Sea; hot water; ice; bathymetry; climate change; coastal current; ice shelf; mass balance; melting; numerical model; sea level change; twenty first century; Antarctica; atmosphere; climate; greenhouse effect; melting point; molecular weight; priority journal; review; sea; seashore; surface property; water temperature",""
